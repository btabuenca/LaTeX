abstract = {Learning analytics (LA) is one of the promising techniques that has been developed in recent times to effectively utilise the astonishing volume of student data available in higher education. Despite many difficulties in its widespread implementation, it has proved to be a very useful way to support failing learners. An important feature of the literature review of LA is that LA has not provided a significant benefit in terms of learner mobility to date since not much research has been carried out to determine the importance of LA in facilitating or enhancing the learning experience of mobile learners. Therefore, this paper describes the potential advantages of using LA techniques to enhance learning in mobile and ubiquitous learning environments from a theoretical perspective. Furthermore, we describe our simplified Mobile and Ubiquitous Learning Analytics Model (MULAM) for analysing mobile learners’ data which is based on Campbell and Oblinger’s five-step model of learning analytics. Finally, we answer the question why now might be the most suitable time to consider analysing mobile learners’ data.},

abstract = {Interaction with smart objects can be accomplished with different technologies, such as tangible interfaces or touch computing, among others. Some of them require the object to be especially designed to be 'smart', and some other are limited in the variety and complexity of the possible actions. This paper describes a user-smart object interaction model and prototype based on the well known event-condition-action (ECA) reasoning, which can work, to a degree, independently of the intelligence embedded into the smart object. It has been designed for mobile devices to act as mediators between users and smart objects and provides an intuitive means for personalization of object's behavior. When the user is close to an object, this one publishes its 'event \& action' capabilities to the user's device. The user may accept the object's module offering, which will enable him to configure and control that object, but also its actions with respect to other elements of the environment or the virtual world. The modular ECA interaction model facilitates the integration of different types of objects in a smart space, giving the user full control of their capabilities and facilitating creative mash-uping to build customized functionalities that combine physical and virtual actions.},

abstract = {Today's mobile devices are natively equipped with multimedia means for children to capture and share their daily experiences. However, designing authoring tools that effectively integrate the discrete media-capture components of mobile devices to enable rich expression remains a challenge. We report results of a study on the observed use of StoryKit, a mobile application that integrates multimodal media-capture tools to support the creation of multimedia stories on the iPhoneiPod TouchiPad. The primary objectives of the study were to explore the ways in which StoryKit enables individuals to create and share personal stories; and to investigate how the created stories themselves might inform the design of mobile storytelling applications. Its results suggest that StoryKit's relatively simple but well-integrated interface enables the creation of vibrant, varied narratives.

It begins with the rationale for this development, and the underlying design and development principles of our learning objects. It then presents the iterative development process that ensued in creating four prototypes for the mobile phone, each of which was refi ned in light of use and feedback. The design issues and solutions are discussed in the process, documenting the development route that was taken. Student evaluation data is also presented, and this has informed the further development of the prototype. The development sections are followed by a discussion about the implications of this work, and the chapter concludes with where it is going in the future.},

Ninety college students completed a time-management questionnaire in 1983; their high school Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores were obtained from college records. Principal-components analysis of the 35-item time-management instrument revealed 3 components. In 1987, 4 years later, each student's cumulative grade point average was obtained from college records. Regression analyses showed that 2 time-management components were significant predictors of cumulative grade point average (R2 = .21) and accounted for more variance than did SAT scores (increment in R2 = .05). It is concluded that time-management practices may influence college achievement.},

abstract = {Many teaching practices implicitly assume that conceptual knowledge can be abstracted from the situations in which it is learned and used. This article argues that this assumption inevitably limits the effectiveness of such practices. Drawing on recent research into cognition as it is manifest in everyday activity, the authors argue that knowledge is situated, being in part a product of the activity, context, and culture in which it is developed and used. They discuss how this view of knowledge affects our understanding of learning, and they note that conventional schooling too often ignores the influence of school culture on what is learned in school. As an alternative to conventional practices, they propose cognitive apprenticeship (Collins, Brown, \& Newman, in press), which honors the situated nature of knowledge. They examine two examples of mathematics instruction that exhibit certain key features of this approach to teaching.},

abstract = {Despite the fact that adaptive hypermedia techniques have proven their ability to provide user guidance and orientation in hyperspace, we do not currently see the widespread adoption of these techniques. A couple of reasons may explain this phenomenon. One of them is the current lack of re-usability and interoperability between adaptive techniques/systems, which – to some degree – originates in the so-called “open corpus problem” found in adaptive hypermedia. In this article, we analyze this problem in a popular arena: adaptive hypermedia systems with an emphasis on education. The origins and effects of the open corpus problem are discussed, and recent approaches are demonstrated that have – in one way or the other – developed as strategies for solving the open corpus problem. We summarize these findings and discuss how solution strategies can be successfully employed in the future, enabling adaptive hypermedia techniques within open, dynamic information spaces, such as the Semantic Web.},

This project sought to explore life-like behaviour as a means of increasing user’s sympathy for everyday ob- jects. We present a prototype that was informally tested with six participants in a situated user test. The results indicate that sympathy and perceived cuteness can arise from life-like movements that, as we propose, represent an object’s will of its own. This work is part of a larger series of experiments in the Living Interfaces project, ex- ploring ways in which reduced life-like movements can be beneficial for Human-Machine Interaction.},

Pocket PCs are easy to carry and use as a distance learning platform. In this paper, we focus on the issues of transferring the current PC based Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) to Pocket PC based. We will also introduce the Pocket SCORM Run-Time Environment (RTE) which has been developed in our lab. Pocket SCORM architecture is able to operate, even when the mobile device is off-line. It will keep the students' learning record. When it is on line, the records will then be sent back to Learning Management System (LMS). With memory limitation, we provides course caching algorithm to exchange the course content on the Pocket SCORM.},

abstract = {This study explores the relationship between students' self-regulated learning (SRL) ability and their ePortfolio achievement in a language enhancement programme. Undergraduate students (N = 26) were asked to create several ePortfolio showcases to demonstrate their English language learning experience over a period of three months. Upon completion of the programme, participants' SRL ability was measured by the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) and their achievement was assessed using an ePortfolio scoring system. Our findings reveal that higher-order cognitive skills (i.e. elaboration, organization, critical thinking), metacognitive control strategies (i.e. self-regulation) and collaborative learning strategies (i.e. peer learning) were positively correlated with the ePortfolio achievement of participants. The results not only provide evidence to support that ePortfolio development is a complex process that cannot simply be driven by surface learning strategies, but also suggest that students should be equipped with appropriate SRL strategies to successfully participate in and benefit from ePortfolio activities. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Clark2012,
abstract = {The proliferation of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers has recently been extended to include a growing ecosystem of increasingly sophisticated chemistry software packages, commonly known as apps. The capabilities that these apps can offer to the practicing chemist are approaching those of conventional desktop-based software, but apps tend to be focused on a relatively small range of tasks. To overcome this, chemistry apps must be able to seamlessly transfer data to other apps, and through the network to other devices, as well as to other platforms, such as desktops and servers, using documented file formats and protocols whenever possible. This article describes the development and state of the art with regard to chemistry-aware apps that make use of facile data interchange, and some of the scenarios in which these apps can be inserted into a chemical information workflow to increase productivity. A selection of contemporary apps is used to demonstrate their relevance to pharmaceutical research. Mobile apps represent a novel approach for delivery of cheminformatics tools to chemists and other scientists, and indications suggest that mobile devices represent a disruptive technology for drug discovery, as they have been to many other industries.},

abstract = {Portable devices are increasingly employed in a wide range of mobile guidance applications. Typical examples are guides in urban areas, museum guides, and exhibition space aids. The demand is for the delivery of context-specific services, wherein the context is typically identified by a combination of data related to location, time, user profile, device profile, network conditions and usage scenario. A context-aware mobile guide is intended to provide guidance services adjusted to the context of the received request. The adjustment may refer to tailoring the user interface to the perceived context, as well as delivering the right type of information to the right person at the right time and the right location. It may also refer to intermediary adaptation, as in the case of mobile multimedia transmission. This paper offers a taxonomy of mobile guides considering multiple criteria. The taxonomy considers several aspects of the mobile applications space, including context awareness, client architectures, mobile user interfaces, as well as offered functionalities, highlighting functional, architectural, technological, and implementation issues. Existing implementations are classified accordingly and a discussion of research issues and emerging trends is offered. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Fischer,
abstract = {Learning can no longer be dichotomized into a place and time to acquire knowledge (school) and a place and time to apply knowledge (the workplace). Today's citizens are flooded with more information than they can handle, and tomorrow's workers will need to know far more than any individual can retain. Lifelong learning is an essential challenge for inventing the future of our societies; it is a necessity rather than a possibility or a luxury to be considered. Lifelong learning is more than adult education and/or training-it is a mindset and a habit for people to acquire. Lifelong learning creates the challenge to understand, explore, and support new essential dimensions of learning such as self-directed learning, learning on demand, collaborative learning, and organizational learning. These approaches need new media and innovative technologies to be adequately supported. A theory of lifelong learning must investigate new frameworks to learning required by the profound and accelerating changes in the nature of work and education. These changes include: a) an increasing prevalence of "high-technology" jobs requiring support for learning on demand because coverage of all concepts is impossible; (b) the inevitability of change in the course of a professional lifetime, which necessitates lifelong learning; and (c) the deepening (and disquiet ing) division between the opportunities offered to the educated and to the uneducated. This article explores conceptual frameworks and innovative computational environments to support lifelong learning. It also analyzes why training approaches need to be transcended and how this can be done.},

abstract = {A fundamental objective of human–computer interaction research is to make systems more usable, more useful, and to provide users with experiences fitting their specific background knowledge and objectives. The challenge in an information-rich world is not only to make information available to people at any time, at any place, and in any form, but specifically to say the “right” thing at the “right” time in the “right” way. Designers of collaborative human–computer systems face the formidable task of writing software for millions of users (at design time) while making it work as if it were designed for each individual user (only known at use time). User modeling research has attempted to address these issues. In this article, I will first review the objectives, progress, and unfulfilled hopes that have occurred over the last ten years, and illustrate them with some interesting computational environments and their underlying conceptual frameworks. A special emphasis is given to high-functionality applications and the impact of user modeling to make them more usable, useful, and learnable. Finally, an assessment of the current state of the art followed by some future challenges is given.},

@article{Gillani2014,
abstract = {Despite the hype and speculation about the role massively open online courses (MOOCs) may play in higher education, empirical research that explores the realities of interacting and learning in MOOCs is in its infancy. MOOCs have evolved from previous incarnations of online learning but are distinguished in their global reach and semi-synchronicity. Thus, it is important to understand the ways that learners from around the world interact in these settings. In this paper, we ask three questions: (1) What are the demographic characteristics of students that participate in MOOC discussion forums? (2) What are the discussion patterns that characterize their interactions? And (3) How does participation in discussion forums relate to students' final scores? Analysis of nearly 87,000 individuals from one MOOC reveals three key trends. First, forum participants tend to be young adults from the Western world. Secondly, these participants assemble and disperse as crowds, not communities, of learners. Finally, those that engage explicitly in the discussion forums are often higher-performing than those that do not, although the vast majority of forum participants receive “failing” marks. These findings have implications for the design and implementation of future MOOCs, and how they are conceptualised as part of higher education.},

abstract = {With the increase in available educational data, it is expected that Learning Analytics will become a powerful means to inform and support learners, teachers and their institutions in better understanding and predicting personal learning needs and performance. However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.},

abstract = {An emerging technology called Near Field Communication (NFC) is used to enable touch between mobile devices. This paper describes how a mobile social media system called 'Hot in the City' (HIC) enables people to make friend connections on the spot when they meet each other. We first describe the HIC system, and then explain how the visibility of friends is arranged in the system. The research focuses on the context during the action of friend connection and how context data should be taken into account in design. A use pilot was organized to study the use of HIC. Observations from the pilot lead us to reconsider the HIC mobile application logic, study location and status information, and plan to add event and time as useful contextual data to organize collected and generated mobile information. Finally, design issues for the next steps are delineated.},

abstract = {The ever-growing computation and storage capability of mobile phones have given rise to mobile-centric context recognition systems, which are able to sense and analyze the context of the carrier so as to provide an appropriate level of service. As nonintrusive autonomous sensing and context recognition are desirable characteristics of a personal sensing system; efforts have been made to develop opportunistic sensing techniques on mobile phones. The resulting combination of these approaches has ushered in a new realm of applications, namely opportunistic user context recognition with mobile phones. This article surveys the existing research and approaches towards realization of such systems. In doing so, the typical architecture of a mobile-centric user context recognition system as a sequential process of sensing, preprocessing, and context recognition phases is introduced. The main techniques used for the realization of the respective processes during these phases are described, and their strengths and limitations are highlighted. In addition, lessons learned from previous approaches are presented as motivation for future research. Finally, several open challenges are discussed as possible ways to extend the capabilities of current systems and improve their real-world experience.},

abstract = {When students self-regulate studying, they monitor achievement and study tactics. Proximal input to monitoring is perceptions that the student constructs based on experience. Productive self-regulation theoretically requires strong correspondence between (a) perceptions of achievement and actual achievement and (b) perceived use of study tactics and actual use of study tactics. That is, calibration should be high. Students studied using a software tool that traced study tactics they used. Subsequently their self-reports about study tactics and estimates of achievement were gathered, and a test was administered. Students were slightly positively biased (overconfident) about their achievement and moderately positively biased about (overestimated) their use of study tactics. An individual difference measure of calibration was very high for achievement but modest for study tactics. It is explained why calibration of self-reports about study tactics did not predict achievement, examine theoretical links between calibration and other prominent constructs, and discuss issues of self-regulated learning. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

@book{Latour2005,
abstract = {Reassembling the Social is a fundamental challenge from one of the world's leading social theorists to how we understand society and the 'social'.Bruno Latour's contention is that the word 'social', as used by Social Scientists, has become laden with assumptions to the point where it has become misnomer. When the adjective is applied to a phenomenon, it is used to indicate a stablilized state of affairs, a bundle of ties that in due course may be used to account for another phenomenon. But Latour also finds the word used as if it described a type of material, in a comparable way to an adjective such as 'wooden' or 'steely'. Rather thansimply indicating what is already assembled together, it is now used in a way that makes assumptions about the nature of what is assembled. It has become a word that designates two distinct things: a process of assembling; and a type of material, distinct from others.Latour shows why 'the social' cannot be thought of as a kind of material or domain, and disputes attempts to provide a 'social explanations' of other states of affairs. While these attempts have been productive (and probably necessary) in the past, the very success of the social sciences mean that they are largely no longer so. At the present stage it is no longer possible to inspect the precise constituents entering the social domain.Latour returns to the original meaning of 'the social' to redefine the notion, and allow it to trace connections again. It will then be possible to resume the traditional goal of the social sciences, but using more refined tools. Drawing on his extensive work examining the 'assemblages' of nature, Latour finds it necessary to scrutinize thoroughly the exact content of what is assembled under the umbrella of Society.This approach, a 'sociology of associations', has become known as Actor-Network-Theory, and this book is an essential introduction both for those seeking to understand Actor-Network Theory, or the ideas of one of its most influential proponents.},

abstract = {Over the next 10 years, we anticipate that personal, portable, wirelessly net- worked technologies will become ubiquitous in the lives of learners—indeed, in many countries, this is already a reality.We see that ready-to-hand access creates the potential for a new phase in the evolution of technology-enhanced learning, characterised by ‘seamless learning spaces’ and marked by con- tinuity of the learning experience across different scenarios or contexts, and emerging from the availability of one device or more per student. The chal- lenge is to enable learners to learn whenever they are curious and seamlessly switch between different contexts, such as between formal and informal con- texts and between individual and social learning, and by extending the social spaces inwhich learners interact with each other. In this paper,we review the potential of mobile learning research for designing seamless learning environ- ments that can bridge both formal and informal learning, present a research agenda and discuss important methodological issues that concern research into formal and informal learning.},

It describes the three curricular components that defined the project, then highlights how a studio method was used to guide students' design work and develop their design literacies. In particular, the article focuses on one of the main design activities students engaged in--collaboratively designing an Augmented Reality simulation--and explores how the embedded design practices align with a socio-cultural view of literacy (Gee, 2004; Jenkins, Purushotma, Clinton, Weigel, \& Robison, 2006; Lankshear and Knobel, 2007; Robison, 2009).

We approach our design from an embodied interaction perspective and conduct our exploration through a series of sketching-driven co-design sessions with senior yoga students and instructors.

abstract = {Ambient lifestyle feedback systems are embedded computer systems designed to motivate changes in a person's lifestyle by reflecting an interpretation of targeted behavior back to the person. Other interactive systems including "serious games" have been applied for the same purpose in areas such as nutrition, health and energy conservation, but they suffer from drawbacks such as inaccurate self-reporting, burdens placed on the user, and lack of effective feedback. Ambient lifestyle feedback systems overcome these challenges by relying on passive observation, calm presentation style and emotionally engaging feedback content. In this paper, we present an ambient lifestyle feedback system concept and provide insights from the design and implementation of two prototype systems, Virtual Aquarium and Mona Lisa Bookshelf. In particular, we discuss the theory and practice of effective feedback design by drawing on elementary behavioral psychology and small-scale user studies. The work is aimed at aiding in the design of ambient persuasive technologies and ambient interaction in general.},

@article{OMalley2004,
abstract = {The computer is now a familiar object in most schools in the UK today. However, outside schools different approaches to interacting with digital information and representations are emerging. These can be considered under the term tangible interfaces, which attempts to overcome the difference between the ways we input and control information and the ways this information is represented. These tangible interfaces may be of significant benefit to education by enabling, in particular, younger children to play with actual physical objects augmented with computing power. Tangible technologies are part of a wider body of developing technology known as ubiquitous computing, in which computing technology is so embedded in the world that it disappears. Tangible technologies differ in terms of the behaviour of control devices and resulting digital effects. A contrast is made between input devices where the form of user control is arbitrary and has no special behavioural meaning with respect to output (eg using a generic tool like a mouse to interact with the output on a screen), and input devices which have a close correspondence in behavioural meaning between input and output (eg using a stylus to draw a line directly on a tablet or touchscreen). The form of such mappings may result in one-to-many relations between input and output (as in arbitrary relations between a mouse, joystick or trackpad and various digital effects on a screen), or one-to-one relations (as in the use of special purpose transducers where each device has one function). Tangibles also differ in terms of the degree of metaphorical relationship between the physical and digital representation. They can range from being completely analogous, in the case of physical devices resembling their digital counterparts, to having no analogy at all. They also differ in terms of the role of the control device, irrespective of its behaviour and representational mapping. So, for example, a control device might play the role of a container of digital information, a representational token of a digital referent, or a generic tool representing some computational function. Finally, these technologies differ in terms of degree of embodiment. This means the degree of attention paid to the control device as opposed to that which it represents; completely embodied systems are where the users primary focus is on the object being manipulated rather than the tool being used to manipulate the object. This can be more or less affected by the extent of the metaphor used in mapping between the control device and the resulting effects. In general there are at least two senses in which tangible user interfaces strive to achieve really direct manipulation: In the mappings between the behaviour of the tool (physical or digital) which the user uses to engage with the object of interest. In the mappings between the meaning or semantics of the representing world (eg the control device) and the represented world (eg the resulting output). Research from psychology and education suggests that there can be real benefits for learning from tangible interfaces. Such technologies bring physical activity and active manipulation of objects to the forefront of learning. Research has shown that, with careful design of the activities themselves, children (older as well as younger) can solve problems and perform in symbol manipulation tasks with concrete physical objects when they fail to perform as well using more abstract representations. The point is not that the objects are concrete and therefore somehow easier to understand, but that physical activity itself helps to build representational mappings that serve to underpin later more symbolically mediated activity after practise and the resulting explicitation of sensorimotor representations. However, other research has shown that it is important to build in activities that support children in reflecting upon the representational mappings themselves. This work suggests that focusing childrens attention on symbols as objects may make it harder for them to reason with symbols as representations. Some researchers argue for cycling between what they call expressive and exploratory modes of learning with tangibles. A number of examples of tangible technologies are presented in this review. These are discussed under four headings: digitally augmented paper, physical objects as icons (phicons), digital manipulatives and sensors/probes. The reason for treating digital paper as a distinct category is to make the point that, rather than ICT replacing paper and book-based learning activities, they can be enhanced by a range of digital activities, from very simple use of cheap barcodes printed on sticky labels and attached to paper, to the much more sophisticated use of video tracing in the augmented reality examples. However, even this latter technology is accessible for current UK schools but without the need for special head-mounted displays to view the augmentation. For example, webcams and projectors can be used with the augmented reality software to overlay videos and animations on top of physical objects. Although many of the technologies reviewed in the section on phicons involves fairly sophisticated systems, once again, it is possible to imagine quite simple and cheap solutions. For example, bar code tags and tag readers are relatively inexpensive. Tags can be embedded in a variety of objects. The only slightly complex aspect is that some degree of programming is necessary to make use of the data generated by the tag reader. Finally, implications are drawn for future research, applications and practice. Although there is evidence that, for example, physical action with concrete objects can support learning, its benefits depend on particular relationships between action and prior knowledge. Its benefits also depend on particular forms of representational mapping between physical and digital objects. For example, there is quite strong evidence suggesting that, particularly with young children, if physical objects are made too realistic they can actually prevent children learning about what the objects represent. Other research reviewed here has also suggested that so-called really direct manipulation may not be ideal for learning applications where often the goal is to encourage the learner to reflect and abstract. This is borne out by research showing that transparent or really easyto-use interfaces sometimes lead to less effective problem solving. This is not an argument that interfaces for learning should be made difficult to use the point is to channel the learners attention and effort towards the goal or target of the learning activity, not to allow the interface to get in the way. In the same vein, Papert argued that allowing children to construct their own interface (ie build robots or write programs) focused the childs attention on making their implicit knowledge explicit. Other researchers support this idea and argue that effective learning should involve both expressive activity, where the tangible represents or embodies the learners behaviour (physically or digitally), and exploratory activity, where the learner explores the model embodied in the tangible interface},

abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) concerns the application of general models of regulation and self-regulation of cognition, motivation/affect, behavior, and context to issues of learning, in particular, academic learning that takes place in school or classroom contexts. This chapter first discusses some of the common features of a number of models of SRL to provide an overview and general framework for theory and research in SRL. A second purpose of this chapter involves a discussion of motivational constructs, specifically goal orientation, may be related to processes of SRL. To accomplish these two general aims, a framework for SRL is discussed first, followed by a summary of different goal orientations and how they may be linked to the different components of SRL. As part of this discussion, a taxonomy of goal orientations is presented. It is suggested that an approach–mastery goal orientation is generally adaptive for cognition, motivation, learning, and performance in an academic context.},

In this review we revisit the classic definitions of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in light of contemporary research and theory. Intrinsic motivation remains an important construct, reflecting the natural human propensity to learn and assimilate. However, extrinsic motivation is argued to vary considerably in its relative autonomy and thus can either reflect external control or true self-regulation. The relations of both classes of motives to basic human needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness are discussed. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

@article{Sandberg2005,
abstract = {When procedures and processes to assure patient location based on human performance do not work as expected, patients are brought incrementally closer to a possible "wrong patient-wrong procedure'' error. We developed a system for automated patient location monitoring and management. Real-time data from an active infrared/radio frequency identification tracking system provides patient location data that are robust and can be compared with an "expected process'' model to automatically flag wrong-location events as soon as they occur. The system also generates messages that are automatically sent to process managers via the hospital paging system, thus creating an active alerting function to annunciate errors. We deployed the system to detect and annunciate "patient-in-wrong-OR'' events. The system detected all "wrong-operating room (OR)'' events, and all "wrong-OR'' locations were correctly assigned within 0.50+/-0.28 minutes (mean+/-SD). This corresponded to the measured latency of the tracking system. All wrong-OR events were correctly annunciated via the paging function. This experiment demonstrates that current technology can automatically collect sufficient data to remotely monitor patient flow through a hospital, provide decision support based on predefined rules, and automatically notify stakeholders of errors.},

The growth and rapid evolution of the wireless technology have created new opportunities for anytime and anywhere learning paradigm. As a result, numerous mobile learning portals have been developed to gain the advantages of it. Nonetheless, there is little research and exploration has been initiated in proposing usability guidelines in designing mobile learning portals to achieve efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction of learning. Thus, this paper seeks to present usability guidelines by grounding the user interface on usability theoretical framework, possible constraints, and unique properties of mobile computing. Three categories of usability have been formulated: user analysis, interaction and interface design. Ten golden usability guidelines have been suggested which aims for designing highly efficacious, user friendly and usable mobile interface to support dynamicity of mobile and handheld devices. Moreover, Mobile Learning Course Manager (MLCM) portal has been developed to demonstrate and exemplify the usability guidelines proposed.},

As collaboration is key to learning in today’s educational environment, mobile technology has tremendous potential in supporting and improving education and its delivery. Given that mobile technology for education is a new phenomenon that is gaining popularity, the values of using mobile technology to support education need to be further researched and better understood. In this research, we used the Value-Focused Thinking approach to interview students and instructors to identify the values of education that are enabled by mobile technology. These values are represented in the form of a means-ends objective network that not only captures the values of education facilitated by mobile technology but also depicts the relationships between these values. The means-ends objective network derived from this research can serve as a conceptual foundation for future studies and provide useful guidelines to practitioners for implementation of mobile technology in education.},

abstract = {The proliferation of smartphones in the last decade and the number of publications in the field of authoring systems for computer-assisted learning depict a scenario that needs to be explored in order to facilitate the scaffolding of learning activities across contexts. Learning resources are traditionally designed in desktop-based authoring systems where the context is mostly restricted to the learning objective, capturing relevant case characteristics, or virtual situation models. Mobile authoring tools enable learners and teachers to foster universal access to educational resources not only providing channels to share, remix or re-contextualize these, but also capturing the context in-situ and in-time. As a further matter, authoring educational resources in a mobile context is an authentic experience where authors can link learning with their own daily life activities and reflections. The contribution of this manuscript is fourfold: first, the main barriers for ubiquitous and mobile authoring of educational resources are identified; second, recent research on mobile authoring tools is reviewed, and 10 key shortcomings of current approaches are identified; third, the design of a mobile environment to author educational resources (MAT for ARLearn) is presented, and the results of an evaluation of usability and hedonic quality are presented; fourth, conclusions and a research agenda for mobile authoring are discussed.

abstract = {During 2 school days and 2 days off, 37 college pupils were offered a daily re- flection and reporting exercise about how (intensity and channels) they learnt in the day. This pilot experiment had 2 purposes: a) to assess the extent to which the mobile phone can be used as an instrument to develop awareness about learning and b) to explore how young people attend to their identity as (life- long) learners when they are prompted to reflect on this theme. Results show that students accepted to answer questions about learning on own mobile appli- ances and outside school hours. The study also provides indications that getting aware of and reflecting about their identity as (professional) learners is not a common and/or understood practice for the participants. These findings, which questions the common life of young people from a learning perspective, are dis- cussed in the light of the call to breed mindful, responsible and committed learners.},

It discusses several issues and educational challenges to be tackled when linking augmented reality and augmented virtuality. Second, the paper describes the architecture of the ARLearn system which offers highly flexible support for different educational settings. Three prototypical use cases implemented based on the underlying ARLearn framework are discussed, which are a field trip system, an augmented Google StreetView client called StreetLearn, and a real time crisis intervention game. ARLearn combines real time notification and mixed reality games across Mobile Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality and the authors aim to use the underlying (open source) framework for further case studies and mixed reality applications for learning support.},

abstract = {Healthcare services are complex and life-critical. One mistake in any procedure may lead to irremediable consequences; numerous researchers, thus, introduce information and communication technology to improve quality of services and enhance patient safety by reducing the medical errors. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is considered as one of the emerging tool assist in meeting the challenges of the present situation. In recent years, RFID has been applied in medical organizations for the purpose of managing and tracking medical equipment, monitoring and identifying patients, ensuring that the right medication is given to the right patient, and preventing the use of counterfeit medicine. However, most of the existing literature focuses on demonstrating how RFID can benefit the healthcare industry, whereas little attention has been given to the management issues involved in constructing an RFID project in medical organizations. In this paper, an exploratory case study is conducted in a medical organization to illustrate the development framework and critical issues that should be taken into consideration in the preparation, implementation and maintenance stage of constructing such a project. All the experiences and results discussed in this paper offer valuable and useful insights to steer those who would like to start their journey using RFID in medical organizations.},

abstract = {Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) has allowed the realization of ubiquitous tracking and monitoring of physical objects wirelessly with minimum human interactions. It plays a key role in a wide range of applications including asset tracking, contactless payment, access control, transportation and logistics, and other industrial applications. On the other side, RFID systems face several technical challenges that need to be overcome in order to achieve their potential benefits; tags collisions and localization of tagged objects are two important challenges. Numerous anti-collision and localization protocols have been proposed to address these challenges. This paper reviews the state-of-art tags' anti-collision and localization protocols, and provides a deep insight into technical issues of these protocols. The probabilistic and deterministic anti-collision protocols are critically studied and compared in terms of different parameters. We further review distance estimation, scene analysis, and proximity localization schemes and provide useful suggestions. We also introduce a new hybrid direction that utilizes power control to spatially partition the interrogation range of a reader for more efficient anti-collision and localization. Finally, we present the applications of RFID systems in healthcare sectors.},

abstract = {The integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) with development projects can change the urban landscape by developing Smart Cities. Smart Cities can dramatically improve their citizens' quality of life, encourage business to invest, and create a sustainable urban environment. This chapter specifically focuses on the various applications of smart object networks in the fields of environmental monitoring, increased public safety and security, efficient resources management such as energy and water, ITS, and the development of new social networks. All of these new applications rely on the deployment of IP smart object networks offering a high degree of scalability, reliability, and security in harsh and unattended environments. Smart object networks will consist of smart objects of various nature such as magnetic, thermal, visual, seismic, infrared, acoustic, and radar, which would be able to monitor a wide variety of ambient conditions that include temperature, humidity, sunlight, soil makeup, air makeup, noise levels, pollution, energy, presence or absence of certain kinds of objects, and mechanical stress levels. In some cases, Virtual Private Network (VPN) technologies can be deployed to logically separate the flows, if required.},

abstract = { The design of a personal, mobile Knowledge and Learning Organisation System (KLeOS) is described. Studies of adult learning practice showed that learning activity is mobile between locations, time slots, and topic areas. Moreover, learning follows a hierarchical organisation at three operational levels: learning activities are discrete acts, which are grouped to form learning episodes, which in turn are grouped to form learning projects. KLeOS reflects this hierarchical structure and allows the user to organise and manage their learning experiences and resources as a visual timeline. In addition, it incorporates a knowledge map, which is updated as the user progresses through learning experiences. The interface of the organiser is based on the idea of timelines and employs project lines and activity lines to represent the user's learning over a lifetime. The organiser forms a bridge between the timeline and the knowledge map by tagging the nodes of knowledge with the context of the learning episode(s) within which that knowledge was acquired. The architecture of KLeOS allows it to be used on a number of different platforms, thus ensuring mobility.},

Dashboards typically capture and visualize traces of learning activities, in order to promote awareness, reflection, and sense-making, and to enable learners to define goals and track progress toward these goals. Based on an analysis of our own work and a broad range of similar learning dashboards, we identify HCI issues for this exciting research area. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

@book{Vygotsky1978,
abstract = {The great Russian psychologist L. S. Vygotsky has long been recognized as a pioneer in developmental psychology. But somewhat ironically, his theory of development has never been well understood in the West. Mind in Society should correct much of this misunderstanding. Carefully edited by a group of outstanding Vygotsky scholars, the book presents a unique selection of Vygotsky's important essays, most of which have previously been unavailable in English.The Vygotsky who emerges from these pages can no longer be glibly included among the neobehaviorists. In these essays he outlines a dialectical-materialist theory of cognitive development that anticipates much recent work in American social science. The mind, Vygotsky argues, cannot be understood in isolation from the surrounding society. Man is the only animal who uses tools to alter his own inner world as well as the world around him. From the handkerchief knotted as a simple mnemonic device to the complexities of symbolic language, society provides the individual with technology that can be used to shape the private processes of mind. In Mind in Society Vygotsky applies this theoretical framework to the development of perception, attention, memory, language, and play, and he examines its implications for education. The result is a remarkably interesting book that is bound to renew Vygotsky's relevance to modem psychological thought.},

After 6 weeks, German university students were added to the groups, but only participated in seven of the ten groups.

abstract = {Activity recognition is a core aspect of ubiquitous computing applications. In order to deploy activity recognition systems in the real world, we need simple sensing systems with lightweight computational modules to accurately analyze sensed data. In this paper, we propose a simple method to recognize human activities using simple object information involved in activities. We apply activity theory for representing complex human activities and propose a penalized naive Bayes classifier for performing activity recognition. Our results show that our method reduces computation up to an order of magnitude in both learning and inference without penalizing accuracy, when compared to hidden Markov models and conditional random fields. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC \& Science Press, China.},

@article{Yao2012,
abstract = {Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology not only offers tracking capability to locate equipment, supplies and people in real time, but also provides efficient and accurate access to medical data for health professionals. However, the reality of RFID adoption in healthcare is far behind earlier expectation. This study reviews literature on the use of RFID in healthcare/hospitals following a formal innovation-decision framework. We aim to identify the common applications, potential benefits, barriers, and critical success factors. Our study facilitates quick assessment and provides guidance for researchers and practitioners in adopting RFID in medical arenas. Many earlier adopters in healthcare found RFID to be functional and useful in such areas as asset tracking and patient identification. Major barriers to adoption include technological limitations, interference concerns, prohibitive costs, lack of global standards and privacy concerns. Better designed RFID systems with low cost and privacy issues addressed are needed to increase acceptance of RFID in healthcare.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce the Tangible Video Editor (TVE), a multi-user, tangible interface for sequencing digital video. We present a new approach to tabletop interaction by using multiple handheld computers embedded in plastic tokens. Drawing from the rich physical experience of tradition film editing techniques we designed the TVE to engage multiple users in a collaborative process and encourage the exploration of narrative ideas. We used active tokens to provide a malleable interface, enabling users to organize the interface components in unspecified ways. Our implementation improves upon common projection-based tabletop interfaces in a number of ways including a design for use beyond dedicated two dimensional spaces and a naturally scaling screen resolution.},
