abstract = {Interaction with smart objects can be accomplished with different technologies, such as tangible interfaces or touch computing, among others. Some of them require the object to be especially designed to be 'smart', and some other are limited in the variety and complexity of the possible actions. This paper describes a user-smart object interaction model and prototype based on the well known event-condition-action (ECA) reasoning, which can work, to a degree, independently of the intelligence embedded into the smart object. It has been designed for mobile devices to act as mediators between users and smart objects and provides an intuitive means for personalization of object's behavior. When the user is close to an object, this one publishes its 'event \& action' capabilities to the user's device. The user may accept the object's module offering, which will enable him to configure and control that object, but also its actions with respect to other elements of the environment or the virtual world. The modular ECA interaction model facilitates the integration of different types of objects in a smart space, giving the user full control of their capabilities and facilitating creative mash-uping to build customized functionalities that combine physical and virtual actions.},

abstract = {Today's mobile devices are natively equipped with multimedia means for children to capture and share their daily experiences. However, designing authoring tools that effectively integrate the discrete media-capture components of mobile devices to enable rich expression remains a challenge. We report results of a study on the observed use of StoryKit, a mobile application that integrates multimodal media-capture tools to support the creation of multimedia stories on the iPhoneiPod TouchiPad. The primary objectives of the study were to explore the ways in which StoryKit enables individuals to create and share personal stories; and to investigate how the created stories themselves might inform the design of mobile storytelling applications. Its results suggest that StoryKit's relatively simple but well-integrated interface enables the creation of vibrant, varied narratives. Further, genre analysis of the types of stories created revealed a surprising volume and diversity of use in educational contexts.},

abstract = {Many teaching practices implicitly assume that conceptual knowledge can be abstracted from the situations in which it is learned and used. This article argues that this assumption inevitably limits the effectiveness of such practices. Drawing on recent research into cognition as it is manifest in everyday activity, the authors argue that knowledge is situated, being in part a product of the activity, context, and culture in which it is developed and used. They discuss how this view of knowledge affects our understanding of learning, and they note that conventional schooling too often ignores the influence of school culture on what is learned in school. As an alternative to conventional practices, they propose cognitive apprenticeship (Collins, Brown, \& Newman, in press), which honors the situated nature of knowledge. They examine two examples of mathematics instruction that exhibit certain key features of this approach to teaching.},

This project sought to explore life-like behaviour as a means of increasing user’s sympathy for everyday ob- jects. We present a prototype that was informally tested with six participants in a situated user test. The results indicate that sympathy and perceived cuteness can arise from life-like movements that, as we propose, represent an object’s will of its own. This work is part of a larger series of experiments in the Living Interfaces project, ex- ploring ways in which reduced life-like movements can be beneficial for Human-Machine Interaction.},

abstract = {AmI proposes a new way of thinking about computers which follows the ideas of the Ubiquitous Computing vision of Mark Weiser. In these, there is what is known as a Disappearing Computer Initiative, with users immersed in intelligent environments. Hence, technologies need to be adapted so that they are capable of replacing the traditional inputs to the system by embedding these in every-day artifacts. In this work we present an approach which uses Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) and Near Field Communication (NFC) technologies. In the latter, a new form of interaction by contact appears. We compare both of these technologies, analyzing the requirements and the advantages of each. In addition, we propose to support activities using a combination of RFID \&amp;amp; NFC.},

@article{Fischer,
abstract = {Learning can no longer be dichotomized into a place and time to acquire knowledge (school) and a place and time to apply knowledge (the workplace). Today's citizens are flooded with more information than they can handle, and tomorrow's workers will need to know far more than any individual can retain. Lifelong learning is an essential challenge for inventing the future of our societies; it is a necessity rather than a possibility or a luxury to be considered. Lifelong learning is more than adult education and/or training-it is a mindset and a habit for people to acquire. Lifelong learning creates the challenge to understand, explore, and support new essential dimensions of learning such as self-directed learning, learning on demand, collaborative learning, and organizational learning. These approaches need new media and innovative technologies to be adequately supported. A theory of lifelong learning must investigate new frameworks to learning required by the profound and accelerating changes in the nature of work and education. These changes include: a) an increasing prevalence of "high-technology" jobs requiring support for learning on demand because coverage of all concepts is impossible; (b) the inevitability of change in the course of a professional lifetime, which necessitates lifelong learning; and (c) the deepening (and disquiet ing) division between the opportunities offered to the educated and to the uneducated. This article explores conceptual frameworks and innovative computational environments to support lifelong learning. It also analyzes why training approaches need to be transcended and how this can be done.},

This paper describes how a mobile social media system called 'Hot in the City' (HIC) enables people to make friend connections on the spot when they meet each other. We first describe the HIC system, and then explain how the visibility of friends is arranged in the system. The research focuses on the context during the action of friend connection and how context data should be taken into account in design. A use pilot was organized to study the use of HIC. Observations from the pilot lead us to reconsider the HIC mobile application logic, study location and status information, and plan to add event and time as useful contextual data to organize collected and generated mobile information. Finally, design issues for the next steps are delineated.},

@article{Hoseini-tabatabaei2013,
abstract = {The ever-growing computation and storage capability of mobile phones have given rise to mobile-centric context recognition systems, which are able to sense and analyze the context of the carrier so as to provide an appropriate level of service. As nonintrusive autonomous sensing and context recognition are desirable characteristics of a personal sensing system; efforts have been made to develop opportunistic sensing techniques on mobile phones. The resulting combination of these approaches has ushered in a new realm of applications, namely opportunistic user context recognition with mobile phones. This article surveys the existing research and approaches towards realization of such systems. In doing so, the typical architecture of a mobile-centric user context recognition system as a sequential process of sensing, preprocessing, and context recognition phases is introduced. The main techniques used for the realization of the respective processes during these phases are described, and their strengths and limitations are highlighted. In addition, lessons learned from previous approaches are presented as motivation for future research. Finally, several open challenges are discussed as possible ways to extend the capabilities of current systems and improve their real-world experience.},

abstract = {This article provides an overview of the use of new technologies for lifelong learning. While in the past learning technologies were mostly provided by educational institutions to support a specific lifetime or shorter learning episodes, nowadays more personal technologies are used for lifelong learning to support self-organized learning. Four important developments are introduced in this article, namely open learner models and learning analytics, learning networks and networked learning, open educational resources and practices, and last but not least, mobile and contextualized learning. The state-of-the-art in these research fields is summarized and the future potential and requirements for lifelong learning are highlighted. s0010},

It describes the three curricular components that defined the project, then highlights how a studio method was used to guide students' design work and develop their design literacies. In particular, the article focuses on one of the main design activities students engaged in--collaboratively designing an Augmented Reality simulation--and explores how the embedded design practices align with a socio-cultural view of literacy (Gee, 2004; Jenkins, Purushotma, Clinton, Weigel, \& Robison, 2006; Lankshear and Knobel, 2007; Robison, 2009).

abstract = {Ambient lifestyle feedback systems are embedded computer systems designed to motivate changes in a person's lifestyle by reflecting an interpretation of targeted behavior back to the person. Other interactive systems including "serious games" have been applied for the same purpose in areas such as nutrition, health and energy conservation, but they suffer from drawbacks such as inaccurate self-reporting, burdens placed on the user, and lack of effective feedback. Ambient lifestyle feedback systems overcome these challenges by relying on passive observation, calm presentation style and emotionally engaging feedback content. In this paper, we present an ambient lifestyle feedback system concept and provide insights from the design and implementation of two prototype systems, Virtual Aquarium and Mona Lisa Bookshelf. In particular, we discuss the theory and practice of effective feedback design by drawing on elementary behavioral psychology and small-scale user studies. The work is aimed at aiding in the design of ambient persuasive technologies and ambient interaction in general.},

@article{OMalley2004,
abstract = {The computer is now a familiar object in most schools in the UK today. However, outside schools different approaches to interacting with digital information and representations are emerging. These can be considered under the term tangible interfaces, which attempts to overcome the difference between the ways we input and control information and the ways this information is represented. These tangible interfaces may be of significant benefit to education by enabling, in particular, younger children to play with actual physical objects augmented with computing power. Tangible technologies are part of a wider body of developing technology known as ubiquitous computing, in which computing technology is so embedded in the world that it disappears. Tangible technologies differ in terms of the behaviour of control devices and resulting digital effects. A contrast is made between input devices where the form of user control is arbitrary and has no special behavioural meaning with respect to output (eg using a generic tool like a mouse to interact with the output on a screen), and input devices which have a close correspondence in behavioural meaning between input and output (eg using a stylus to draw a line directly on a tablet or touchscreen). The form of such mappings may result in one-to-many relations between input and output (as in arbitrary relations between a mouse, joystick or trackpad and various digital effects on a screen), or one-to-one relations (as in the use of special purpose transducers where each device has one function). Tangibles also differ in terms of the degree of metaphorical relationship between the physical and digital representation. They can range from being completely analogous, in the case of physical devices resembling their digital counterparts, to having no analogy at all. They also differ in terms of the role of the control device, irrespective of its behaviour and representational mapping. So, for example, a control device might play the role of a container of digital information, a representational token of a digital referent, or a generic tool representing some computational function. Finally, these technologies differ in terms of degree of embodiment. This means the degree of attention paid to the control device as opposed to that which it represents; completely embodied systems are where the users primary focus is on the object being manipulated rather than the tool being used to manipulate the object. This can be more or less affected by the extent of the metaphor used in mapping between the control device and the resulting effects. In general there are at least two senses in which tangible user interfaces strive to achieve really direct manipulation: In the mappings between the behaviour of the tool (physical or digital) which the user uses to engage with the object of interest. In the mappings between the meaning or semantics of the representing world (eg the control device) and the represented world (eg the resulting output). Research from psychology and education suggests that there can be real benefits for learning from tangible interfaces. Such technologies bring physical activity and active manipulation of objects to the forefront of learning. Research has shown that, with careful design of the activities themselves, children (older as well as younger) can solve problems and perform in symbol manipulation tasks with concrete physical objects when they fail to perform as well using more abstract representations. The point is not that the objects are concrete and therefore somehow easier to understand, but that physical activity itself helps to build representational mappings that serve to underpin later more symbolically mediated activity after practise and the resulting explicitation of sensorimotor representations. However, other research has shown that it is important to build in activities that support children in reflecting upon the representational mappings themselves. This work suggests that focusing childrens attention on symbols as objects may make it harder for them to reason with symbols as representations. Some researchers argue for cycling between what they call expressive and exploratory modes of learning with tangibles. A number of examples of tangible technologies are presented in this review. These are discussed under four headings: digitally augmented paper, physical objects as icons (phicons), digital manipulatives and sensors/probes. The reason for treating digital paper as a distinct category is to make the point that, rather than ICT replacing paper and book-based learning activities, they can be enhanced by a range of digital activities, from very simple use of cheap barcodes printed on sticky labels and attached to paper, to the much more sophisticated use of video tracing in the augmented reality examples. However, even this latter technology is accessible for current UK schools but without the need for special head-mounted displays to view the augmentation. For example, webcams and projectors can be used with the augmented reality software to overlay videos and animations on top of physical objects. Although many of the technologies reviewed in the section on phicons involves fairly sophisticated systems, once again, it is possible to imagine quite simple and cheap solutions. For example, bar code tags and tag readers are relatively inexpensive. Tags can be embedded in a variety of objects. The only slightly complex aspect is that some degree of programming is necessary to make use of the data generated by the tag reader. Finally, implications are drawn for future research, applications and practice. Although there is evidence that, for example, physical action with concrete objects can support learning, its benefits depend on particular relationships between action and prior knowledge. Its benefits also depend on particular forms of representational mapping between physical and digital objects. For example, there is quite strong evidence suggesting that, particularly with young children, if physical objects are made too realistic they can actually prevent children learning about what the objects represent. Other research reviewed here has also suggested that so-called really direct manipulation may not be ideal for learning applications where often the goal is to encourage the learner to reflect and abstract. This is borne out by research showing that transparent or really easyto-use interfaces sometimes lead to less effective problem solving. This is not an argument that interfaces for learning should be made difficult to use the point is to channel the learners attention and effort towards the goal or target of the learning activity, not to allow the interface to get in the way. In the same vein, Papert argued that allowing children to construct their own interface (ie build robots or write programs) focused the childs attention on making their implicit knowledge explicit. Other researchers support this idea and argue that effective learning should involve both expressive activity, where the tangible represents or embodies the learners behaviour (physically or digitally), and exploratory activity, where the learner explores the model embodied in the tangible interface},

abstract = {A complex view of learning recognises that learning cannot be pre-determined by teaching, but is as much defined by circumstances and context as pre-defined learning objectives. Learning designs that accept uncertainty help us to envision classrooms and curricula that are open, dynamic and innovative. Architect Christopher Alexanders patterns and pattern language offer a means for researchers, practitioners, learners, and technologists to capture and share the emergent processes of complex learning. This paper examines the unique properties of patterns that support complex design tasks and suggests a design-based research framework for operationalising its practice. Through the thoughtful explication, mining and construction of patterns, all participants can contribute to a richer learning system. Keywords},

abstract = {Intrinsic and extrinsic types of motivation have been widely studied, and the distinction between them has shed important light on both developmental and educational practices. In this review we revisit the classic definitions of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in light of contemporary research and theory. Intrinsic motivation remains an important construct, reflecting the natural human propensity to learn and assimilate. However, extrinsic motivation is argued to vary considerably in its relative autonomy and thus can either reflect external control or true self-regulation. The relations of both classes of motives to basic human needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness are discussed. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

@article{Sandberg2005,
abstract = {When procedures and processes to assure patient location based on human performance do not work as expected, patients are brought incrementally closer to a possible "wrong patient-wrong procedure'' error. We developed a system for automated patient location monitoring and management. Real-time data from an active infrared/radio frequency identification tracking system provides patient location data that are robust and can be compared with an "expected process'' model to automatically flag wrong-location events as soon as they occur. The system also generates messages that are automatically sent to process managers via the hospital paging system, thus creating an active alerting function to annunciate errors. We deployed the system to detect and annunciate "patient-in-wrong-OR'' events. The system detected all "wrong-operating room (OR)'' events, and all "wrong-OR'' locations were correctly assigned within 0.50+/-0.28 minutes (mean+/-SD). This corresponded to the measured latency of the tracking system. All wrong-OR events were correctly annunciated via the paging function. This experiment demonstrates that current technology can automatically collect sufficient data to remotely monitor patient flow through a hospital, provide decision support based on predefined rules, and automatically notify stakeholders of errors.},

As collaboration is key to learning in today’s educational environment, mobile technology has tremendous potential in supporting and improving education and its delivery. Given that mobile technology for education is a new phenomenon that is gaining popularity, the values of using mobile technology to support education need to be further researched and better understood. In this research, we used the Value-Focused Thinking approach to interview students and instructors to identify the values of education that are enabled by mobile technology. These values are represented in the form of a means-ends objective network that not only captures the values of education facilitated by mobile technology but also depicts the relationships between these values. The means-ends objective network derived from this research can serve as a conceptual foundation for future studies and provide useful guidelines to practitioners for implementation of mobile technology in education.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous technologies and the Internet of Things have been identified in several reports as tendencies to assimilate in the coming years. The ubiquitous learning is the direct beneficiary of the rapid incorporation of mobile learning into daily tasks. Mobile devices are equipped with different tools that provide good support to the student standing in formal, informal and / or professional. This paper presents the development of ubiquitous technologies and the Internet of Things in the past decade. We describe a representation model of ubiquitous learning ecologies combining physical and digital world. Relevant technologies are described and cases focusing on applicability lifelong learner as an active and on mobile devices as a learning tool. Finally, we present the results of a survey of 21 principals content repositories about their intentions to support mobile technologies in the coming years.},

abstract = {The proliferation of smartphones in the last decade and the number of publications in the field of authoring systems for computer-assisted learning depict a scenario that needs to be explored in order to facilitate the scaffolding of learning activities across contexts. Learning resources are traditionally designed in desktop-based authoring systems where the context is mostly restricted to the learning objective, capturing relevant case characteristics, or virtual situation models. Mobile authoring tools enable learners and teachers to foster universal access to educational resources not only providing channels to share, remix or re-contextualize these, but also capturing the context in-situ and in-time. As a further matter, authoring educational resources in a mobile context is an authentic experience where authors can link learning with their own daily life activities and reflections. The contribution of this manuscript is fourfold: first, the main barriers for ubiquitous and mobile authoring of educational resources are identified; second, recent research on mobile authoring tools is reviewed, and 10 key shortcomings of current approaches are identified; third, the design of a mobile environment to author educational resources (MAT for ARLearn) is presented, and the results of an evaluation of usability and hedonic quality are presented; fourth, conclusions and a research agenda for mobile authoring are discussed.

This pilot experiment had 2 purposes: a) to assess the extent to which the mobile phone can be used as an instrument to develop awareness about learning and b) to explore how young people attend to their identity as (life- long) learners when they are prompted to reflect on this theme. Results show that students accepted to answer questions about learning on own mobile appli- ances and outside school hours. The study also provides indications that getting aware of and reflecting about their identity as (professional) learners is not a common and/or understood practice for the participants. These findings, which questions the common life of young people from a learning perspective, are dis- cussed in the light of the call to breed mindful, responsible and committed learners.},

Second, the paper describes the architecture of the ARLearn system which offers highly flexible support for different educational settings. Three prototypical use cases implemented based on the underlying ARLearn framework are discussed, which are a field trip system, an augmented Google StreetView client called StreetLearn, and a real time crisis intervention game. ARLearn combines real time notification and mixed reality games across Mobile Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality and the authors aim to use the underlying (open source) framework for further case studies and mixed reality applications for learning support.},

abstract = {Healthcare services are complex and life-critical. One mistake in any procedure may lead to irremediable consequences; numerous researchers, thus, introduce information and communication technology to improve quality of services and enhance patient safety by reducing the medical errors. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is considered as one of the emerging tool assist in meeting the challenges of the present situation. In recent years, RFID has been applied in medical organizations for the purpose of managing and tracking medical equipment, monitoring and identifying patients, ensuring that the right medication is given to the right patient, and preventing the use of counterfeit medicine. However, most of the existing literature focuses on demonstrating how RFID can benefit the healthcare industry, whereas little attention has been given to the management issues involved in constructing an RFID project in medical organizations. In this paper, an exploratory case study is conducted in a medical organization to illustrate the development framework and critical issues that should be taken into consideration in the preparation, implementation and maintenance stage of constructing such a project. All the experiences and results discussed in this paper offer valuable and useful insights to steer those who would like to start their journey using RFID in medical organizations.},

abstract = {Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) has allowed the realization of ubiquitous tracking and monitoring of physical objects wirelessly with minimum human interactions. It plays a key role in a wide range of applications including asset tracking, contactless payment, access control, transportation and logistics, and other industrial applications. On the other side, RFID systems face several technical challenges that need to be overcome in order to achieve their potential benefits; tags collisions and localization of tagged objects are two important challenges. Numerous anti-collision and localization protocols have been proposed to address these challenges. This paper reviews the state-of-art tags' anti-collision and localization protocols, and provides a deep insight into technical issues of these protocols. The probabilistic and deterministic anti-collision protocols are critically studied and compared in terms of different parameters. We further review distance estimation, scene analysis, and proximity localization schemes and provide useful suggestions. We also introduce a new hybrid direction that utilizes power control to spatially partition the interrogation range of a reader for more efficient anti-collision and localization. Finally, we present the applications of RFID systems in healthcare sectors.},

Smart Cities can dramatically improve their citizens' quality of life, encourage business to invest, and create a sustainable urban environment. This chapter specifically focuses on the various applications of smart object networks in the fields of environmental monitoring, increased public safety and security, efficient resources management such as energy and water, ITS, and the development of new social networks. All of these new applications rely on the deployment of IP smart object networks offering a high degree of scalability, reliability, and security in harsh and unattended environments. Smart object networks will consist of smart objects of various nature such as magnetic, thermal, visual, seismic, infrared, acoustic, and radar, which would be able to monitor a wide variety of ambient conditions that include temperature, humidity, sunlight, soil makeup, air makeup, noise levels, pollution, energy, presence or absence of certain kinds of objects, and mechanical stress levels. In some cases, Virtual Private Network (VPN) technologies can be deployed to logically separate the flows, if required.},

abstract = { The design of a personal, mobile Knowledge and Learning Organisation System (KLeOS) is described. Studies of adult learning practice showed that learning activity is mobile between locations, time slots, and topic areas. Moreover, learning follows a hierarchical organisation at three operational levels: learning activities are discrete acts, which are grouped to form learning episodes, which in turn are grouped to form learning projects. KLeOS reflects this hierarchical structure and allows the user to organise and manage their learning experiences and resources as a visual timeline. In addition, it incorporates a knowledge map, which is updated as the user progresses through learning experiences. The interface of the organiser is based on the idea of timelines and employs project lines and activity lines to represent the user's learning over a lifetime. The organiser forms a bridge between the timeline and the knowledge map by tagging the nodes of knowledge with the context of the learning episode(s) within which that knowledge was acquired. The architecture of KLeOS allows it to be used on a number of different platforms, thus ensuring mobility.},

@book{Vygotsky1978,
abstract = {The great Russian psychologist L. S. Vygotsky has long been recognized as a pioneer in developmental psychology. But somewhat ironically, his theory of development has never been well understood in the West. Mind in Society should correct much of this misunderstanding. Carefully edited by a group of outstanding Vygotsky scholars, the book presents a unique selection of Vygotsky's important essays, most of which have previously been unavailable in English.The Vygotsky who emerges from these pages can no longer be glibly included among the neobehaviorists. In these essays he outlines a dialectical-materialist theory of cognitive development that anticipates much recent work in American social science. The mind, Vygotsky argues, cannot be understood in isolation from the surrounding society. Man is the only animal who uses tools to alter his own inner world as well as the world around him. From the handkerchief knotted as a simple mnemonic device to the complexities of symbolic language, society provides the individual with technology that can be used to shape the private processes of mind. In Mind in Society Vygotsky applies this theoretical framework to the development of perception, attention, memory, language, and play, and he examines its implications for education. The result is a remarkably interesting book that is bound to renew Vygotsky's relevance to modem psychological thought.},

Inspired by the exposition by Chan et al. (2006) on the seamless learning model sup- ported by the setting of one or more mobile device per learner, this paper aims to further investigate the meaning of seamless learning and the potential ways to put it in practice. Through a thorough review of recent academic papers on mobile-assisted seamless learning (MSL), we identify ten dimensions that characterize MSL. We believe that such a framework allows us to identify research gaps in the stated area. A practitioner interested in adopting an MSL design or doing a new design can use our analysis to situate the dimensional space where the constraints or parameters of his or her design problem lie, and look at relevant design and research-based evidence of other related MSL systems to refine her own design.},

In order to deploy activity recognition systems in the real world, we need simple sensing systems with lightweight computational modules to accurately analyze sensed data.

We apply activity theory for representing complex human activities and propose a penalized naive Bayes classifier for performing activity recognition. Our results show that our method reduces computation up to an order of magnitude in both learning and inference without penalizing accuracy, when compared to hidden Markov models and conditional random fields. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC \& Science Press, China.},

We aim to identify the common applications, potential benefits, barriers, and critical success factors. Our study facilitates quick assessment and provides guidance for researchers and practitioners in adopting RFID in medical arenas. Many earlier adopters in healthcare found RFID to be functional and useful in such areas as asset tracking and patient identification. Major barriers to adoption include technological limitations, interference concerns, prohibitive costs, lack of global standards and privacy concerns. Better designed RFID systems with low cost and privacy issues addressed are needed to increase acceptance of RFID in healthcare.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce the Tangible Video Editor (TVE), a multi-user, tangible interface for sequencing digital video. We present a new approach to tabletop interaction by using multiple handheld computers embedded in plastic tokens. Drawing from the rich physical experience of tradition film editing techniques we designed the TVE to engage multiple users in a collaborative process and encourage the exploration of narrative ideas. We used active tokens to provide a malleable interface, enabling users to organize the interface components in unspecified ways. Our implementation improves upon common projection-based tabletop interfaces in a number of ways including a design for use beyond dedicated two dimensional spaces and a naturally scaling screen resolution.},
