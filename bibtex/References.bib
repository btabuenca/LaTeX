abstract = {This paper addresses two problems: "What are the appropriate methods for evaluating information systems?” and “How do we measure the impact of ambient information systems?” Inspired by concepts in the social and behavioral science, we categorize the evaluation of ambient displays into two styles: intrusive and non- intrusive. Furthermore, two case studies are used to illustrate these two evaluation styles. An intrusive evaluation of MoneyColor shows that the correct disruptive order for ambient displays is animation, color, area and shape. A non-intrusive evaluation of Fisherman proposes an effectiveness measurement, and reveals three issues to improve the effectiveness of ambient displays.},

@misc{O'Reilly2005,
abstract = {The bursting of the dot-com bubble in the fall of 2001 marked a turning point for the web. Many people concluded that the web was overhyped, when in fact bubbles and consequent shakeouts appear to be a common feature of all technological revolutions. Shakeouts typically mark the point at which an ascendant technology is ready to take its place at center stage. The pretenders are given the bum's rush, the real success stories show their strength, and there begins to be an understanding of what separates one from the other. The concept of "Web 2.0" began with a conference brainstorming session between O'Reilly and MediaLive International. Dale Dougherty, web pioneer and O'Reilly VP, noted that far from having "crashed", the web was more important than ever, with exciting new applications and sites popping up with surprising regularity. What's more, the companies that had survived the collapse seemed to have some things in common. Could it be that the dot-com collapse marked some kind of turning point for the web, such that a call to action such as "Web 2.0" might make sense? We agreed that it did, and so the Web 2.0 Conference was born. In the year and a half since, the term "Web 2.0" has clearly taken hold, with more than 9.5 million citations in Google. But there's still a huge amount of disagreement about just what Web 2.0 means, with some people decrying it as a meaningless marketing buzzword, and others accepting it as the new conventional wisdom. This article is an attempt to clarify just what we mean by Web 2.0.},

The current DeskJockey prototype utilizes a projected desk and allows information to be moved easily between active and passive displays using a world-in-miniature interaction metaphor. A four-week, in-situ field study was conducted to compare usage of DeskJockey with typical multiple monitor use. The results revealed potential for utilizing passive physical surfaces in this manner and demonstrated that this type of display space has distinctive affordances and benefits which enhance traditional display space.},

Presently, little is known in this regard and techniques for evaluating these types of displays are just beginning to be developed. In this article, we focus on one aspect of a peripheral display's effectiveness---its ability to communicate information at a glance. We conducted an evaluation of the InfoCanvas, a peripheral display that conveys awareness information graphically as a form of information art, by assessing how well people recall information when it is presented for a brief period of time. We compare performance of the InfoCanvas to two other electronic information displays, a Web portal style and a text-based display, when each display was viewed for a short period of time. We found that participants noted and recalled significantly more information when presented by the InfoCanvas than by either of the other displays despite having to learn the additional graphical representations employed by the InfoCanvas.},

abstract = {The design of technological interventions to motivate behaviour-based reductions in end-user energy consumption has recently been identified as a priority for the HCI community. Previous interventions have produced promising results, but have typically focused on domestic energy consumption. By contrast, this paper focuses on the workplace context, which presents very different opportunities and challenges. For instance, financial consequences, which have proved successful as motivations in the domestic environment, are not present in the workplace in the context of employees. We describe the outcome of a sequence of workshops that focussed on understanding employee perceptions of energy use in the workplace, with the locus of activity on energy intervention design. Using a grounded theory analysis, we produced a framework of key themes detailing user perceptions and energy intervention design considerations. Our findings provide a framework of considerations for the design of successful workplace energy interventions.},

abstract = {Many teaching practices implicitly assume that conceptual knowledge can be abstracted from the situations in which it is learned and used. This article argues that this assumption inevitably limits the effectiveness of such practices. Drawing on recent research into cognition as it is manifest in everyday activity, the authors argue that knowledge is situated, being in part a product of the activity, context, and culture in which it is developed and used. They discuss how this view of knowledge affects our understanding of learning, and they note that conventional schooling too often ignores the influence of school culture on what is learned in school. As an alternative to conventional practices, they propose "cognitive apprenticeship" (Collins, Brown, \& Newman, in press), which honors the situated nature of knowledge. They examine two examples of mathematics instruction that exhibit certain key features of this approach to teaching.},

abstract = {Several evaluations dual trade-off of team awareness systems showed, that interruptions and privacy violations during usage often lead to the rejection of the system by users. Most authors argue that this rejection is due to a fundamental between sending privacy, and between receiving awareness awareness information and resource consumption. While the assumption of a fundamental trade-off information and disruption or is widely accepted in state-of-the-art research, this paper disputes the predominant hypothesis. Instead, it is argued, that the trade-off is not of fundamental nature, but caused by neglecting elementary aspects in the design process. In order to verify this line of argument, a novel interface concept for mediating socio- emotional awareness information is presented. To verify the validity of the conceptual approach, several evaluations were conducted. The evaluations verified the approach of this paper and showed, that a cautious interface design can enhance user privacy in multi-user awareness systems and minimize disruptive effects on primary tasks, without reducing awareness mediation and usability.},

We argue that, as a design principle, "invisibility" has advantages in powerful, some domains; but that it has and ultimately counterproductive, connotations for educational design. We present an alternative set of potential design principles for educational ubiquitous computing, stressing values such as expressiveness, creative control, and aesthetics; and we illustrate these principles with several projects undertaken in our lab.},

abstract = {Unlike traditional information visualization, ambient information visualizations reside in the environment of the user rather than on the screen of a desktop computer. Currently, most dynamic infor- mation that is displayed in public places consists of text and num- bers. We argue that information visualization can be employed to make such dynamic data more useful and appealing. However, visualizations intended for non-desktop spaces will have to both provide valuable information and present an attractive addition to the environment – they must strike a balance between aesthetical appeal and usefulness. To explore this, we designed a real-time visualization of bus departure times and deployed it in a public space, with about 300 potential users. To make the presentation more visually appealing, we took inspiration from a modern abstract artist. The visualiza- tion was designed in two passes. First, we did a preliminary ver- sion that was presented to and discussed with prospective users. Based on their input, we did a final design. We discuss the lessons learned in designing this and previous ambient information visual- izations, including how visual art can be used as a design con- straint, and how the choice of information and the placement of the display affect the visualization.},

It was verified that the disruptiveness and effectiveness of notifications varied with the notification modality. The olfactory modality was shown to be less effective in delivering notifications than the other modalities, but produced a less disruptive effect on user engagement in the primary task.

abstract = {(from the jacket) In this new book, Donald A. Sch\"{o}n argues that professional education should be centered on enhancing the practitioner's ability for "reflection-in-action"that is, learning by doing and developing the ability for continued learning and problem solving throughout the professional's career. Building on the concepts of professional competence first introduced in his book "The Reflective Practitioner," Sch\"{o}n offers a new approach to educating professionals in all areas. And he shows how professional schools can use this approach to prepare students to handle the complex and unpredictable problems of actual practice with confidence, skill, and care. (jacket) Using examples from an architectural design studio and the arts, Sch\"{o}n demonstrates how reflection-in-action can be fostered in students. He describes in detail an approach that involves active coaching by a master teachergiving students practice facing real problems, testing solutions, making mistakes, seeking help, and refining approachesand suggests how professional schools can use such coaching to produce practitioners with solid problem-solving skills. Extensive dialogues between teachers and students also illustrate how reflection-in-action works, what encourages it, and behavior or attitudes that can prevent the development of reflectiveness.

abstract = {Ambient information systems, often referred to as ambient displays, peripheral displays or informative art systems (IAS), aim at providing users with information considered relevant at arbitrary points of work or living en- gagement, in easy and quickly to convey, aesthetic and artful style. Adhering principles of visual perception, visualization and design, information coming from various different (hardware and software) sensors is aggregated through abstraction and selective omission, and displayed at the periphery of a user's at- tention. A broad range of visual metaphors ranging from the fine arts, abstract art, naive art, comic drawings up to photographic images or technical drawings have been proposed, but all grounded on the “I-throw-it-out-there-and-watch” design paradigm1, totally excluding the user, his background knowledge and his aesthetic appreciation from the design process. This paper advocates for a user- oriented, participatory design process for IASs. Addressing canvas style IASs, i.e. displays that decorate apartments, offices, foyers and the like in the first (but not the only) place, in our approach the choice of the IAS canvas theme is left to the user. To steer the (design) process of identifying symbols within a chosen theme we have developed categories of metaphors like color, space, shape, ab- straction, scale and dimension, and discuss their potential with respect to pre- attentive and interpretative cognition. From experiments with users we find, that the choice of themes and the identification of metaphoric symbols are con- sidered as a means of personal emotional expression (or in other words, as “a matter of taste”). Aesthetic attractiveness turns out to be a dominant factor of IAS appreciation. A general purpose software framework for IASs is presented, implementing sensor data acquisition, context recognition, aggregation and fil- tering, as well as 2D/3D graphics engine, dynamically controlling the visual ap- pearance of themes and symbols.},

abstract = {The differential effects of 2 forms of feedback on energy consumption behavior were examined in 2 units of a metallurgical company. In 1 unit, employees received information about energy conservation, had to set goals, and received feedback on their own conservation behavior. The same procedure was followed with employees in a 2nd unit, but they also received information about the performance of the 1st unit. In accordance with predictions from social identity theory and social comparison theory, the results clearly showed that employees in the comparative feedback condition saved more energy than employees who only received information about their own performance, even half a year after the intervention. A remarkable finding was that behavioral change took place with hardly any changes in attitudes or intentions. The discussion focuses on these findings and on their implications for organizational behavior change in general. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved).},

abstract = {Ambient displays are attractive, subtle visualisations of information. They are typically situated on the periphery of human perception, requiring minimal effort to be understood. The vast volume of communication facilitated by modern means of communication has led to research into methods of visualising this information to facilitate rapid understanding. These two research areas have, however, seldom been combined to include the use of ambient displays as visualisations of personal communication patterns. The research outlined in this paper addresses this issue by combining ambient displays and visualisation of personal communication patterns in a mobile context. This paper details the development of the AmbiMate system, analyses its usefulness and investigates the lessons which can be learned from its implementation in order to guide the future development of such systems.},

As researchers, we tend to rely on learning gains measured in controlled conditions. As teachers and designers, the skilled management of classroom constraints results in the impression that a design works well. We argue that the generalizability of educational research requires that we take into account curriculum, assessment, time, energy, space and safety constraints when designing methods and environments. We systematically describe 14 design factors related to the notions of classroom orchestration and learning ecosystems and illustrate their embodiment in three learning environments from our own research. The design factors provide a teacher-centric, integrated view of educational technology design for face-to-face classroom activities which work well.},

@book{Sterling2005,
abstract = {"Shaping Things is about created objects and the environment, which is to say, it's about everything," writes Bruce Sterling in this addition to the Mediawork Pamphlet series. He adds, "Seen from sufficient distance, this is a small topic." Sterling offers a brilliant, often hilarious history of shaped things. We have moved from an age of artifacts, made by hand, through complex machines, to the current era of "gizmos." New forms of design and manufacture are appearing that lack historical precedent, he writes; but the production methods, using archaic forms of energy and materials that are finite and toxic, are not sustainable. The future will see a new kind of objectwe have the primitive forms of them now in our pockets and briefcases: user-alterable, baroquely multi-featured, and programmablethat will be sustainable, enhanceable, and uniquely identifiable. Sterling coins the term "spime" for them, these future manufactured objects with informational support so extensive and rich that they are regarded as material instantiations of an immaterial system. Spimes are designed on screens, fabricated by digital means, and precisely tracked through space and time. They are made of substances that can be folded back into the production stream of future spimes, challenging all of us to become involved in their production. Spimes are coming, says Sterling. We will need these objects in order to live; we won't be able to surrender their advantages without awful consequences. The vision of Shaping Things is given material form by the intricate design of Lorraine Wild. Shaping Things is for designers and thinkers, engineers and scientists, entrepreneurs and financiersand anyone who wants to understand and be part of the process of technosocial transformation.},

abstract = {We present a technique for evaluating the usability and effectiveness of ambient displays. Ambient displays are abstract and aesthetic peripheral displays portraying non-critical information on the periphery of a user's attention. Although many innovative displays have been published, little existing work has focused on their evaluation, in part because evaluation of ambient displays is difficult and costly. We adapted a low-cost evaluation technique, heuristic evaluation, for use with ambient displays. With the help of ambient display designers, we defined a modified set of heuristics. We compared the performance of Nielsen's heuristics and our heuristics on two ambient displays. Evaluators using our heuristics found more, severe problems than evaluators using Nielsen's heuristics. Additionally, when using our heuristics, 3-5 evaluators were able to identify 40--60\% of known usability issues. This implies that heuristic evaluation is an effective technique for identifying usability issues with ambient displays.},

abstract = {Concept mapping is a type of structured conceptualization which can be used by groups to develop a conceptual framework which can guide evaluation or planning. In the typical case, six steps are involved: (1) Preparation (including selection of participants and development of focus for the conceptualization); (2) the Generation of statements; (3) the Structuring of statements; (4) the Representation of Statements in the form of a concept map (using multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis); (5) the Interpretation of maps; and, (6) the Utilization of maps. Concept mapping: encourages the group to stay on task; results relatively quickly in an interpretable conceptual framework; expresses this framework entirely in the language of the participants; yields a graphic or pictorial product which simultaneously shows all major ideas and their interrelationships; and often improves group or organizational cohesiveness and morale. This paper describes each step in the process, considers major methodological issues and problems, and discusses computer programs which can be used to accomplish the process. 1989.},

Because transportation is inherently a mobile activity, mobile devices are well suited to sense and provide feedback about these activities. In this paper, we explore the use of personal ambient displays on mobile phones to give users feedback about sensed and self-reported transportation behaviors. We first present results from a set of formative studies exploring our respondents' existing transportation routines, willingness to engage in and maintain green transportation behavior, and reactions to early mobile phone "green" application design concepts. We then describe the results of a 3-week field study (N=13) of the UbiGreen Transportation Display prototype, a mobile phone application that semi-automatically senses and reveals information about transportation behavior. Our contributions include a working system for semi-automatically tracking transit activity, a visual design capable of engaging users in the goal of increasing green transportation, and the results of our studies, which have implications for the design of future green applications.},

abstract = {One of the problems with notification appliances is that they can be distracting when providing information not of immediate interest to the user. In this paper, we present AuraOrb, an ambient notification appliance that deploys progressive turn taking techniques to minimize notification disruptions. AuraOrb uses eye contact sensing to detect user interest in an initially ambient light notification. Once detected, it displays a text message with a notification heading visible from 360 degrees. Touching the orb causes the associated message to be displayed on the user's computer screen.We performed an initial evaluation of AuraOrb's functionality using a set of heuristics tailored to ambient displays. Results of our evaluation suggest that progressive turn taking techniques allowed AuraOrb users to access notification headings with minimal impact on their focus task.},

abstract = {We develop an interaction framework for huge public displays with multiple users in public spaces such as concourses, lobbies in buildings, and rendezvous spots. Based on this framework, we introduce an interactive system for public spaces called Mirai-Tube1. This system creates a scalable interactive media space and has a scalable real-time recognizer. A Mirai-Tube system was installed in the underground concourse of Minato Mirai Station in Yokohama. We conducted a demonstration experiment from 1st Feb. to 31st Oct. 2004. This trial represents the world's first experiment in a real public space in terms of its scale and its time period. We evaluate our interactive media system from three points of view: acceptability as a public media, how much attention the public pays to it, and its understandability as an advertising media. This paper describes the features, implementation, and operation of the interactive media system and the results of the evaluation.},

We describe two prototype applications that use crossmodal cues to temporally multiplex publicly visible information: CROSSFLOW, an ambient navigation system; and CROSSBOARD, a dense multi- user public information display. We outline the results of pilot preliminary user studies and describe the infrastructure required to support crossmodal displays.},

abstract = {This [textbook] helps establish important new links between environmental science and behavioral science. It develops a framework for addressing key questions about human behaviors that harm the environment, summarizes knowledge from psychology and related fields about these behaviors, and uses that knowledge to point the way to realistic solutions. This book develops a framework for addressing these questions, drawing on behavioral theory, real world case studies, field experiments, and other evidence. Because its central focus is individual behavior, it draws most heavily on concepts from social, cognitive, and behavioral psychology. However, it puts behavior in the context of the economic, institutional, and policy forces that shape it and emphasizes arenas where individual action makes a real difference to the natural environment. The result is an interdisciplinary treatment, rooted in behavioral science but addressing practical issues of environmental policy. The book is written at a level suitable for undergraduate students in psychology, social science, and environmental studies and science.},

Following an introductory chapter that frames the agenda of the report, chapter 2 summarizes some of the key. findings from "How People Learn" and outlines implications of those findings for teaching and for designing classroom environments. "How people Learn" is a large report; this document focuses on the findings and messages that are most relevant to classroom practice. Chapter 3 summarizes responses from educators and policymakers that were offered at a conference and workshop that discussed "How people Learn." More specific suggestions made by conference and workshop participants are incorporated into chapter 4, in which the workshop committee presents its recommendations for a research and development agenda. The agenda is organized around: (1) educational materials; (2) preservice and inservice education; (3) public policy; and (4) public opinion and the media. Appendixes list meeting participants with their biographical sketches. (Contains 58 references.) (SLD)},

abstract = {The launch of the International Journal of Mobile and Blended Learning is one of several indicators that mobile learning globally is reaching a critical and sustainable momentum and identity. The past six or seven years have seen a host of pilots and initiatives across sectors and across countries and these have established firstly that mobile learning takes learning to individuals, communities and countries where access to learning was challenging or problematic and secondly that mobile learning enhances, enriches and extends how learning is understood. Environmental factors have meant that this development has been haphazard. The mobile learning community is now faced with broader challenges of scale, durability, equity, embedding and blending in addition to the earlier and more specific challenges of pedagogy and technology, but these developments take place in the context of societies where mobile devices, systems and technologies have a far wider impact than just mobile learning as it is currently conceived.

We have been working at the intersection of three research areas - tangible interfaces, ambient displays, and collaboration awareness. Our system, Nimio, uses engaging physical objects as both input devices (capturing aspects of individual activity) and output devices (expressing aspects of group activity). We present our design and experiences, focusing in particular on the tension between legibility and ambiguity and its relevance in collaborative settings.},

abstract = {Ambient display is a specific subfield of information visualization that only uses partial visual and cognitive attention of its users. Conducting an evaluation while drawing partial user attention is a challenging problem. Many normal information visualization evaluation methods (full attention) may not suit the evaluation of ambient displays. Inspired by concepts in the social and behavioral science, we categorize the evaluation of ambient displays into two methodologies: intrusive and non-intrusive. The major difference between these two approaches is the level of user involvement, as an intrusive evaluation requires a higher user involvement than a non-intrusive evaluation. Based on our long-term (5 months) non-intrusive evaluation of Fisherman presented in [16], this paper provides a detailed discussion of the actual technical and experimental setup of unobtrusively measurement of user gaze over a long period by using a face-tracking camera and IR sensors. In addition, this paper also demonstrates a solution to the ethical problem of using video cameras to collect data in a semi-public place. Finally, a quantitative term of "interest" measurement with three remarks is also addressed.},

This work has yielded rich examples of design approaches to the problem of presenting information about a user's world in a way that is not distracting, but is aesthetically pleasing, and tangible to varying degrees. Despite these successes, accumulating theoretical and craft knowledge has been stymied by the lack of a unified vocabulary to describe these systems and a consequent lack of a framework for understanding their design attributes. We argue that this area would significantly benefit from consensus about the design space of ambient information systems and the design attributes that define and distinguish existing approaches. We present a definition of ambient information systems and a taxonomy across four design dimensions: Information Capacity, Notification Level, Representational Fidelity, and Aesthetic Emphasis. Our analysis has uncovered four patterns of system design and points to unexplored regions of the design space, which may motivate future work in the field.},

The 'Power-Aware Cord' is a re-design of a common electrical power strip that displays the amount of energy passing through it at any given moment. This is done by dynamic glowing patterns produced by electroluminescent wires molded into the transparent electrical cord. Using this fully functional prototype, we have been investigating how such ambient displays can be used to increase energy awareness. An initial user study indicates that the Power-Aware Cord is a very accessible and intuitive mean for better understanding energy consumption.

Learners participate in communities of practitioners, moving toward full participation in the sociocultural practices of a community. Legitimate peripheral participation provides a way to speak about crucial relations between newcomers and oldtimers and about their activities, identities, artifacts, knowledge and practice. The communities discussed in the book are midwives, tailors, quartermasters, butchers, and recovering alcoholics, however, the process by which participants in those communities learn can be generalized to other social groups.},

Even if we know the importance, it is difficult to change our undesirable habits and to maintain a desirable lifestyle. This study demonstrates a concept called ambient lifestyle feedback sys- tems to be used to motivate people to change their undesirable habits to improve their lifestyle. In the concept, aesthetic and empathetic ex- pressions reflect the feedback of the user’s current behavior to the user. When keeping desirable habits, the user is offered with a feedback expres- sion designed to boost his positive emotion. When turning to undesirable habits, the feedback expression is changed to increase the user’s negative emotions. In this paper, we present brief overviews of four case studies of ambient lifestyle feedback systems, and discuss several findings that we while designing and evaluating the case studies. Future directions will also be discussed.},

We compare the list of usability violations found in the heuristic evaluation to the set of problems that were discovered in the in situ evaluation. Overall, the 'Heuristic Evaluation of Ambient Displays' was effective - 75\% of known usability problems were found by eight evaluators (39-55\% were found by 3-5 evaluators). However, the most severe usability problem found in the in situ evaluation was not identified in the heuristic evaluation. Because the problem directly violated one of the heuristics, we believe that the problem is not with the heuristics, but rather that evaluators have minimal experience with ambient displays for the home.},

Twenty-eight participants in three experimental conditions used our UbiFit system for a period of three months in their day-to-day lives over the winter holiday season. Our results show, for example, that participants who had an awareness display were able to maintain their physical activity level (even during the holidays), while the level of physical activity for participants who did not have an awareness display dropped significantly.

MessyBoard is a large, projected, shared bulletin board that is decorated collaboratively by a small group of users.We built these programs with the goal of helping people remember more of the content that they access through a computer. Our approach is to embed content within distinct contexts. For instance, a computer with multiple projection screens could surround the user with panoramic vistas that correspond to projects that the user is working on. Since few people are willing to create their own context, we created MessyDesk and MessyBoard in order to entice people to decorate.Though we have not yet evaluated the impact of either program on users' memories, we have observed people using these programs over a several week period. From anecdotal evidence, we believe that MessyDesk may be a good tool for decoration and information management. MessyBoard became popular when we projected the board on the wall in our lab. We have seen that different research groups use it differently. One group uses it mostly for jokes and games, and another group uses it for long design discussions. It is good for scheduling, and supports factual as well as emotional communication among group members.},

Based on fieldwork with deaf and hearing participants, we focused on supporting awareness of non-speech audio sounds such as ringing phones and knocking in a work environment. Unlike past work, our designs support both monitoring and notification of sounds, support discovery of new sounds, and do not require a priori knowledge of sounds to be detected. Our Spectrograph design shows pitch and amplitude, while our Positional Ripples design shows amplitude and location of sounds. A controlled experiment involving deaf participants found neither display to be significantly distracting. However, users preferred the Positional Ripples display and found that display easier to monitor (notification sounds were detected with 90\% success in a laboratory setting). The Spectrograph display also supported successful detection in most cases, and was well received when deployed in the field.},

By using this feature, environmental information acquired from real world and knowledge on social activities of people are inte- grated effectively. From experimental results using a proto- type of uEyes for supervising elderly people, we show that the social context awareness, as well as other components of the system, effectively works to support the supervision.},

We hope to motivate immediate reduction in water use as well as higher-order behaviors (seeking new information, etc) through unobtrusive low-cost water flow sensing and several persuasive displays. Early prototypes were installed at public faucets and a private (shared) shower, logging water usage first without and then with ambient displays. This pilot study led to design iterations, culminating in long-term deployment of sensors in four private showers over the course of three weeks. Sensors first logged baseline water usage without visualization. Then, two display styles, ambient and numeric, were deployed in random order, each showing individual and average water consumption. Quantitative data along with participants' feedback contrast the effectiveness of numeric displays against abstract visualization in this very important domain of water conservation and public health.},

abstract = {Providing effective feedback on resource consumption in the home is a key challenge of environmental conservation efforts. One promising approach for providing feedback about residential energy consumption is the use of ambient and artistic visualizations. Pervasive computing technologies enable the integration of such feedback into the home in the form of distributed point-of-consumption feedback devices to support decision-making in everyday activities. However, introducing these devices into the home requires sensitivity to the domestic context. In this paper we describe three abstract visualizations and suggest four design requirements that this type of device must meet to be effective: pragmatic, aesthetic, ambient, and ecological. We report on the findings from a mixed methods user study that explores the viability of using ambient and artistic feedback in the home based on these requirements. Our findings suggest that this approach is a viable way to provide resource use feedback and that both the aesthetics of the representation and the context of use are important elements that must be considered in this design space.},

abstract = {This paper presents ReflectiveSigns, i.e. digital signage (pub- lic electronic displays) that automatically learns the audience preferences for certain content in different contexts and presents content accordingly. Initially, content (videos, images and news) are presented in a random manner. Using cameras installed on the signs, the system observes the audience and detects if someone is watching the content (via face de- tection). The anonymous view time duration is then stored in a central database, together with date, time and sign location. When schedul- ing content, the signs calculate the expected view time for each content type depending on sign location and time using a Naive Bayes classifier. Content is then selected randomly, with the probability for each con- tent weighted by the expected view time. The system has been deployed for two months on four digital signs in a university setting using semi- realistic content \& content types. We present a first evaluation of this approach that concentrates on major effects and results from interviews with 15 users.},

abstract = {Decisions about what to eat are often made close to mealtime, when hunger clouds people's ability to think creatively or conscientiously about their meal choices. As a result, people we studied tended to resort to "everyday meals": recipes that are tasty, quick, and cheap. These choices often run counter to cooks' stated values regarding health, variety, ingredient choice, and so forth, but are chosen for their convenience and familiarity. This lack of variety seemed to stem from a scarcity of "everyday" recipes compounded by the fact that usually, at the time they are preparing the meal, cooks are tired, hungry, and don't want to search for or try less familiar recipes. Based on a study of current cooking practices, we developed the SuChef prototype: a low-fidelity probe supporting the in-kitchen display of everyday meal ideas along with the sharing of recipes among members of social groups. The probe was deployed for a week among 5 geographically dispersed but socially connected households and yielded insights into the design space for technology to support everyday cooking.},

abstract = {Peripheral displays are an important class of applications that improve our ability to balance multiple activities. However, peripheral display innovation and development has suffered because much of the past work has been technology driven: There exists little theoretical understanding of how they operate in relation to people's everyday lives. In response to this, we present a framework for understanding, designing, and evaluating peripheral displays based on Activity Theory. We argue that peripheral displays are information displays that become unobtrusive to users. As this quality depends on the context of use, we present a framework for describing peripheral displays based on the number and types of activities they support. Furthermore, we argue that different types of displays require different approaches to evaluation. From our own work and a review of related literature we derive a set of general evaluation criteria for peripheral displays (appeal, learnability, awareness, effects of breakdowns, and distraction). We then describe approaches for evaluating these criteria for different types of peripheral displays and present a case study to illustrate the value of our Activity Theory evaluation framework in practice.},

@article{Fishbein1975,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although there is level I evidence demonstrating the superiority of intravesical therapy in patients with bladder cancer, surveillance strategies are primarily founded on expert opinion. The authors examined compliance with surveillance and treatment strategies and the pursuant impact on survival in patients with high-grade disease. METHODS: Using linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data, the authors identified subjects with a diagnosis of high-grade, non-muscle-invasive disease between 1992 and 2002 who survived 2 years and did not undergo definitive treatment during that time. Nonlinear mixed-effects regression analyses was used to examine compliance with surveillance and treatment strategies. After adjusting for confounders using a propensity score-weighted approach, the authors determined whether individual and comprehensive strategies during the initial 2 years after diagnosis were associated with survival after 2 years. RESULTS: Of 4790 subjects, only 1 received all the recommended measures. Although mean utilization for most measures significantly increased after 1997, only compliance with an induction course of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) increased (13\% to 20\%; P < .001). On multivariate analysis, compliance with 4 cystoscopies, 4 cytologies, and BCG instillation was found to be lower among octogenarians and higher among those with undifferentiated, Tis, and T1 tumors, and among those individuals diagnosed after 1997. Subjects compliant with these measures had a lower hazard of mortality (hazard ratio, 0.41; 95\% confidence interval, 0.18-0.93) than those who received < 4 cystoscopies, < 4 cytologies, and no BCG. CONCLUSION: There was a statistically significant survival advantage found among those who received at least half of the recommended care. Improving compliance with these process-of-care measures via systematic quality improvement initiatives serves as the primary target to meliorate bladder cancer care.

@book{McCullough2004,
abstract = {Digital Ground is an architect's response to the design challenge posed by pervasive computing. One century into the electronic age, people have become accustomed to interacting indirectly, mediated through networks. But now as digital technology becomes invisibly embedded in everyday things, even more activities become mediated, and networks extend rather than replace architecture. The young field of interaction design reflects not only how people deal with machine interfaces but also how people deal with each other in situations where interactivity has become ambient. It shifts previously utilitarian digital design concerns to a cultural level, adding notions of premise, appropriateness, and appreciation. Malcolm McCullough offers an account of the intersections of architecture and interaction design, arguing that the ubiquitous technology does not obviate the human need for place. His concept of "digital ground" expresses an alternative to anytime-anyplace sameness in computing; he shows that context not only shapes usability but ideally becomes the subject matter of interaction design and that "environmental knowing" is a process that technology may serve and not erode. Writing for practising interaction designers, pervasive computing researchers, architects, and the general reader on digital culture, McCullough gives us a theory of place for interaction design.},

Ambient Widget is a context-aware system that provides users with the same information in different formats and volumes depending on the zone. In a zone-based approach, users are provided with a various ranges of information, from ambient and graphics-based information to personal and text-based information depending on the zone the users are in. Users are given a subtle hint with abstract ambient information via messaging in an ambient public situation and are identified through an RFID on a tag inside the detection-zone. They can then read personal messages by actively manipulating the ID tag using gesture-based controls inside the interaction zone. To develop the Ambient Widget device, a tri-axis acceleration sensor was embedded into an ID tag, and seven different gesture interactions with the ID tag were classified to control events for message navigation. Ambient Widget was installed in the lobby area of an international conference so that the participants can communicate through AIS instead of the usual messaging boards. A user study was conducted to evaluate the usability of the components comprising Ambient Widget. 30 users participated in this assessment.},
