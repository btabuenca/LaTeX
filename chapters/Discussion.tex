REFRAME  THIS PARAGRAPH IS FROM (Fischer, G. (2001). User Modeling in Human–Computer Interaction. User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 11, 65–86. doi:10.1023/A:1011145532042):
The challenge in an information-rich world (in which human attention is the most valuable and scarcest commodity) is not only to make information available to people at any time, at any place and in any form, but to reduce information overload by making information relevant to the task-at-hand and to the assumed background knowledge of the users. Techniques to say the ``right'' thing include: (1) support for differential descriptions that relate new information to information and concepts assumed to be known by a speci¢c user; and (2) embedded critiquing systems (Fischer et al., 1998) that make information more relevant to the task-at-hand by generating interactions in real time, on demand, and suited to individual users as needed. They are able to do so by exploiting a richer context provided by the domain orientation of the environment, by the analysis of partially constructed arti- facts and partially completed speci¢cations. To say things at the ``right'' time requires to balance the costs of intrusive interruptions against the loss of con- text-sensitivity of deferred alerts (Horvitz et al., 1999). To say things in the ``right'' way (for examples by using multimedia channel to exploit different sensory channels) is especially critical for users who may suffer from some disability (Stephanidis, 2001).
