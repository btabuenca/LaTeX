\section{Introduction}
In 2004 Learning Objects (LOs) have been named in the Horizon report, as one of the relevant technology trends (Johnson \& Laurence, 2004). This technology appears again in the Horizon report from 2010 (Johnson et al. 2010) as open content, predicting to have an impact in the short term due to the current trend of offering open content for free on the Web. 

Open Educational Resources (OERs) not only comprise LOs, course materials, content modules and collections, they also include tools for creating, delivering, using and improving educational contents. Chitwood \& Bunnow (2005) defined LOs with five characteristics: 1) small units of learning, typically ranging from 2 minutes to 15 minutes; 2)self-contained, each learning object can be taken independently; 3)reusable, a single learning object may be used in multiple contexts for multiple purposes; 4)can be aggregated, learning objects can be grouped into larger collections of content, including traditional course structures; 5)are tagged with metadata, every learning object has descriptive information allowing it to be easily found by a search.
 
The advent of mobile technologies and the boom in 2007 with the birth of smartphones have boosted new ways of interaction. Mobile devices are equipped with capabilities (text editor, audio recorder, video recorder, sensors, internet access, apps, etc.) that facilitate enormously the possibilities to create, publish, discover, acquire, access, use and re-use of educational resources. By mobile device we do not only refer to cell phones, but also to tablets, MP3s, MP4s, game consoles and portable computers. Mobile devices play an important role in lifelong learning. Lifelong learning includes a variety of different educational scenarios and contexts in which learners operate (Tabuenca, Ternier \& Specht; 2012). Hence, mobile devices facilitate ubiquitous access to OERs stored in content repositories.

In the last years, the usage of mobile devices has grown in many application fields of the education. Likewise, a big proportion of the learning contents are now 'consumed' from mobile devices. OERs are normally stored in open repositories facilitating search, retrieval and re-use among educational communities. The work from Su, Tseng, Lin \& Chen (2011) summarizes research on adapted mobile content delivery based on mobile capabilities, learners’ preferences, and network conditions. Less clear and unexplored are the features provided by OER repositories to facilitate access from mobile devices. 

OER repositories must do their best to provide suitable mobile contents. So far no work was found synthesizing how OER repositories are adapting to mobile learning.

This chapter is organized as follows. Section two summarizes common practices in the creation, publication, discovery, acquisition, access, use and re-use of learning objects on mobile devices based on a literature review on research trends from 2007 to 2012. The third section presents the results from a survey performed on 23 educational repository owners prompting them to answer about their current and expected support on mobile devices. Section four analyzes what concrete mobile features are providing the main OER repositories to mobile users. Section five presents discussion and conclusions.
\section{Literature review on learning objects for mobile devices}
This section reviews previews work on the creation, publication, discovery, acquisition, access, and use of mobile OERs.
\subsection{Method}
Five major digital libraries were selected to find relevant papers in the usage of mobile devices to access OERs repositories: ACM, IEEE, Science Direct, Springerlink and Wiley. We searched the listed libraries constructing search-strings that follow the pattern: all papers published after 2006 that contain (“Mobile” AND “learning” AND “object” AND “repository” AND “content” AND “education”) in their full-text AND (contain (“mobile”) in their keywords OR contain (“mobile”) in the title). 

This query reported the following number of items: 21 in ACM; 165 in IEEE; 26 in ScienceDirect; 36 in Springerlink; 12 in Wiley. For each of these libraries, results were ordered by relevance and the 20 first elements were extracted. The resulting list of 92 papers was manually reviewed. 

\subsubsection{Creation of contents}
Nowadays, mobile devices are equipped with capabilities that facilitate the creation of learning contents. Indeed, most mobile users are capable of recording audios, recording videos or composing a text note. The quality of the audio and video reproducers, and the increase of the size of the screens to display text, has augmented considerably the degree of excellence for consuming contents with respect to the pre-smartphone era. The exploratory study by Churchill \& Hedberg (2008) describes considerations to take into account when designing LOs for small-screen handheld devices. 
\subsubsection{Publication of contents}
Standards are being periodically reformulated to adapt the publication of LOs in content repositories. Tagging resources with meta-data is essential to guarantee their reusability. The need for analyzing the issues that raise the inclusion and use of metadata in the learning objects delivered to mobile devices was already pinpointed by De Marcos, Hilera, Gutiérrez, Pagés \& Martínez (2006) as an investigation line pending to develop. For example, the IEEE LOM specification does not directly support the description of educational resources in terms of their relevance to language learning and mobile-delivery related characteristics as claimed by Zervas \& Sampson. (2010). 

Facing this challenge is key for teachers and instructional designers to search, acquire, (re)-use and share educational resources effectively.
\subsubsection{Content allocation}
This review has resulted in the following ways for allocate contents from mobile devices: GPS, compass, Wi-Fi, RFID, infrared, barcode, Bluetooth, text recognition and image recognition. Moreover, 3D virtual environments supported by mobile devices have been implemented in order to facilitate learners to explore and search LOs within OER repositories.

The mobile phone camera has been used with the aim to recognize real images of off-line contents, allowing rapidly gain access to a large repository of multimedia information (Han, Yang \& Jung; 2007). Moreover, augmented reality in textbooks was implemented in Santana-Mancilla, García-Ruiz, Acosta-Diaz \& Juárez, (2012) allowing secondary school students access to additional educational contents related to their textbooks. This system recognizes the images printed in the book as part of regular taught topics and shows multimedia contents that complement the topics covered in the book. Similar, Chao \& Chen (2009) used markers (printed text identifiers) that can be easily read and tracked by a computer to augment text content with multimedia content.

Excursions of art and museum are good examples of content delivery based on the parameters supplied by mobile devices. Mobile guides delivering contextualized audio, video and text are reviewed in recent work from Emmanouilidis et al. (2012). This work claims that the current trend is to gradually abandon some of the older localization technologies such as Wi-Fi, infrared and manual user position input. The near ubiquity of GPS receivers in mobile devices makes this technology extremely popular, nevertheless, they are high battery consumer and they do not work indoors. Oppermann \& Specht (1999) performed the first relevant experiment using infrared for location identification and wireless LAN for data transmission to and from the server in a museum in which audio contents where delivered from a repository. 

Other localization technologies, such as Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) and 2D barcodes, have become more popular due to better device support. Chen, Teng \& Lee (2010) implement an augmented reality scenario enriching textbooks with multimedia content stored in a repository. These contents were addressed reading Quick Response (QR) codes printed next to the text to enrich. Chen \& Huang (2012), Choi \& Moon (2008) and Huang, Chang \& Sandnes (2008) present an implementation of contextualized content delivery indexed by RFIDs. 

Near Field Communication (NFC) is an extension to RFID technology. RFID is capable of accepting and transmitting beyond a few meters while NFC is restricted to within four inches. There is a trend  in mobile phones to be equipped with NFC. This type of communication has been used with the purpose of accessing contents. A recent experiment implemented a scenario in which a user carrying her mobile phone in a fieldtrip excursion could touch (with her mobile phone) objects augmented with NFC tags. When these tags were read with the mobile device, the path to the learning content (i.e. image, video, audio) was decoded and reproduced. Every time a tag is tapped, the action and actor was registered in the system (Pérez-Sanagustín, Ramirez-Gonzalez, Hernández-Leo, Muñoz-Organero, Santos, Blat \& Delgado-Kloos; 2012).

Mobile accelerometer gestures are able to control a 3D car gaming metaphor to navigate learning resources in repositories (see figure 2). This implementation was created by Rahman \& El Saddik (2011) who included an additional functionality to access, play, and store the learning objects for later browsing through the mobile interface.

     \label{fig:2}
\end{figure}

Web browsers keep being the main access point to LO repositories. MERLOT is an example of portal-based repository adapting the search functionality depending on the type of mobile platform aimed to use the content. Siadaty, Eap, Jovanovic, Gasevic, Torniai \& Hatala (2008) propose the m-LOCO framework for contextualized mobile content delivery, making use of the following repositories: 1) the repository of learning objects includes information about the content format (i.e. audio, video, text) and the educational content types (i.e. exercise, example, overview or tutorial); 2)the delivery media repository contains data about specifications and features of different available delivery media (e.g., mobile devices and PDAs); 3)the context repository is used to perform further analysis or reasoning (e.g., every time a learner selects a learning object from the learning object repository, the related contextual data would be gathered and stored in the repository).

\subsubsection{Standards for content packaging, delivery and sequencing}
IMS Learning Design  and the SCORM  are the most important standard models for interoperability and reusability in eLearning. This review has risen the following solutions making use of these standards in mobile devices:

\em Pocket-SCORM\em is a SCORM reader on mobile devices with access to an Learning Management System (LMS) server and a SCORM repository. This tool was first released in June 2004 for Windows Mobile (Chang, Chang, Sie, Lin, Huang, Shih \& Jin; 2004). To the best our knowledge, the \em Pocket-SCORM\em was not further developed. 

\em SMILE PDA\em is an open source software implementation for executing IMS Learning Design activities via mobile devices. In contrast to existing IMS Learning Design Players such as Coppercore\footnote{CopperCore, The IMS Learning Design Engine. http://coppercore.sourceforge.net/} and Reload Player\footnote{Reload Project, Reload IMS LD Player. http://www.reload.ac.uk/}, the \em SMILE PDA\em does not need to be connected to the internet during the entire execution time and has been specially designed for delivery through mobile user interfaces as the educational content can be automatically adjusted to the size of the display of the device used (Sampson \& Zervas; 2008).

The \em eXact-mobile\em \footnote{eXact mobile http://www.exact-learning.com/en/products/learn-exact-suite/exact-mobile-solution-for-mobile-learning} is a commercial solution for standard management, delivery and tracking of multimedia for training. This tool features tracking and synching even when offline as well as content authoring according to recognized standards (i.e. SCORM). This tool supports content delivery for Android, iPhone and Blackberry.

The \em PLCAM\em delivers SCORM mobile LOs based on learners’ preferences, hardware profile and “satisfaction degree” of these contents in previous usages (Su et al. 2011).
\subsubsection{Architectures framing mobile content delivery}
Service-based architectures were recently introduced with the aim to provide educational institutions the flexibility to add and re-use services inside the already existing platforms. Hence, many basic services and resources must not be developed again, reducing considerably the complexity in the design of new educational environments, and focusing the attention on the eLearning platform as center of the on-line education process as repository of both resources and services.  Martin et al. (Martín, Sancristobal \& Castro, 2009) in their review of existent solutions propose an architecture (figure 4) in which LMS services are transferred to mobile devices from Web-Services that outsource the resources via HTTP.
\begin{figure}
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{img/oerrepos_fig4}
     \caption{Integration of LMS services for mobile devices. REFFFFFFFFF HERE}
     \label{fig:4}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Content repositories and ubiquitous computing}
Tagging physical objects (books, pictures, sculptures, etc.) with QR codes or RFID tags to enrich them with multimedia content has resulted in successful experiments. In most of the cases, the resource repository hosts content-related materials that are not originally provided by the physical object: texts (Chen et al. 2010; Chao \& Chen 2009); images (Han et al. 2007; Santana-Mancilla et al. 2012); multimedia (Pérez-Sanagustín et al. 2012). These learning materials are sometimes previously designed by the instructor or be obtained freely from the Internet. 

The review highlights different examples of ubiquitous computing scenarios broadcasting context based learning contents to mobile devices. (Hahn, Barbosa \& Geyer 2007; Barbosa, Hahn \& Barbosa 2008) show how LOs are delivered to learners depending on the physical location of the learner and their progress status completing the tasks. More recently, Rahman \& El Saddik (2012) designed a prototype that makes use of accelerometer and infrared to launch LOs in different displays by pointing at them with the mobile device. This approach represents a case of use where the mobile device is used to distribute where contents should be displayed .
\section{A survey to OER repositories on mobile access}
This section presents the results of a survey performed on 23 content repositories, partners of the Open Discovery Space  European project, hosting more than 1,583,000 resources (this is an approximation since some of the contents might be overlapped in more than one repository). The aim of this survey is to gain insights into the way content repositories provide access to mobile devices. The following table lists the repositories participating in the survey.

\subsection{Method}
This survey collects information about repository’s accessibility via mobile devices, potential future apps and functionalities from the repository owner’s point of view. Content owners received an email in which they were prompted to answer six questions related to mobile usage. Guidelines and examples of possible ways to fill in the requested information were included. The collected files were analyzed obtaining the following results.
\subsection{Results}
This section presents the results of the data collected from the ODS partners



Figure XXXXXXX illustrates the answers reported to the question: Q1.\em Did you prepare your repository to be accessed with different mobile devices?\em . The majority of the repositories (87\%) answered that their repository can be accessed by portable laptops. Tablets are in the second place with 74\% of the repositories. More than 65\% of the repositories are accessible via smartphones. In fact, more than half of the repositories can be explored by all type mobile devices due to the fact that they were accounting access via web browser.

\section{OER repositories' features for mobile devices}
This section reviews specific features provided by OER repositories for mobile access. We have selected relevant OER repositories cited in the literature review having some initiative on mobile support. Moroever, we review relevant referratories that were excluded in the previous section. By referratory we mean repositories that only handle metadata from LO rather, while the LOs are stored somewhere in a different repository. The method to analyze them was browsing their sites and exploring the main app markets in Internet (i.e. Google Play, Apple Store).
\begin{figure}
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{img/oerrepos_fig15}
     \caption{MERLOT repository. Every LO is listed with a QR codes for sticking them on paper material.}
     \label{fig:15}
\end{figure}
The \em OpenScout\em Project was launched in 2012 as a portal that provides free online management of OERs, i.e. search, visualize, use, share and publish. The OpenScout feature an interface to start a keyword-based search, filter search results, include competence search criteria, or add social metadata like tags, comments or ratings. Regarding the features supporting mobile devices, Parodi, Vannucci, Schwertel, Weber, Kawase \& Niemann (2012) describe the OpenScout app for iOS that provides a keyword search in which the search results are sorted by relevance. The apps facilitates access to the details of the resources and bookmark them. Bookmarks are saved locally in the users’ device facilitating the organization and collection of items that the user might find relevant.

\em Mobile2Learn\em is a European Project that aims at improving language-learning instruction by expanding the resources for teaching and learning in vocational education training.  This portal intends to promote access to mobile-supported training services for the provision of on-demand lifelong language learning, beyond time and place restrictions. Mobile2Learn provides a stand-alone application (MW-TELL) that can be installed in a PDA or smartphone device and facilitates the delivery of mobile training courses. The main functionalities of MW-TELL Courses PDA and Smartphones Player include: delivery of mobile training courses packages for English language learning; support of multiples roles, such as individual learners and tutors; rendering of HTML–based content and flash files conformant with the IMS Learning Design v1.0 Level A specification and IMS Content Packaging v1.1.4 specification.  Sampson \& Zervas (2012) present an implementation of the Mobile2Learn framework for English language-learning concluding the following indications: existing Mobile-Assisted Lifelong Language Learning (MALL) resources can be re-used within different MALL courses, while retaining their open access by different platforms and systems; existing MALL course templates can be re-used within different MALL courses addressing teaching of a specific language. Moreover, MW-TELL has been experimented in Romero, Zarraonandia, Aedo \& Diaz (2010).
 	 	 
\em MERLOT\em is a free and open online community of resources designed primarily for faculty, staff and students of higher education from around the world to share their learning materials and pedagogy. MERLOT provides different capabilities for mobile support. The free MERLOT OER search app for iOS and Android-based mobile devices searches the MERLOT database for open educational materials. MERLOT OER Search app enables mobile users to retrieve detailed, discipline-based information on thousands of Open Courses, Open Texts, and Open Journal articles directly from MERLOT’s internationally renowned digital library.  Retrieved information includes all the comments, ratings, related learning exercises, and peer review information stored in MERLOT’s digital library, with links directly to the learning materials in the hit list. It is possible to share findings with colleagues via mobile device. Moreover, MERLOT maintains and index to mobile app with educational purposes.  All the materials listed in MERLOT include a QR code with an URL redirecting to the learning materials so they can be easily shared or bound to paper materials (See Figure 15 a.). Additionally, MERLOT provides an advanced search (Figure 15 b.) for materials designed for mobile devices including the criteria “Type of delivery platform” to the information (metadata on smartphones, tablets, LMS’s). Moreover, MERLOT guides through a step-by-step process for creating and cataloging new mobile apps useful for teaching and learning.

\em The OpenCourseWare (OCW) \em movement initially started in Tübingen (Germany) but it was finally launched at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (OCW-MIT), an open, free, web-based publication of all courses and contents taught at MIT. This initiative has been widely extended to multiple universities around the world. MIT-OCW released their iPhone app in February 2011 (Figure 16) allowing to access OCW videos stored in iTunes. Its social learning experience makes this app different from others. This app includes a virtual space called “classmates” where students can discuss with colleagues. 


\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
Mobile devices facilitate new ways to access content in OER repositories. This chapter has shed light on different prototypes and tools using GPS, compass, Wi-Fi, RFID, NFC, infrared, QR code, Bluetooth, text recognition, image recognition or the accelerometer to index contents stored in learning repositories. These features have been put into practice in different experiments (Chen et al. 2010; Chao \& Chen 2009; Han et al. 2007; Santana-Mancilla et al. 2012; Pérez-Sanagustín et al. 2012; Hahn et al. 2007; Barbosa et al. 2008; Rahman \& El Saddik 2012) with successful results. This study shows cues on how to augment physical objects (books, museums, etc.) with digital learning contents delivered to mobile devices and extracted from content repositories.
\em Khan Academy’s\em website supplies a free online collection of more than 3,500 micro lectures via video tutorials stored on YouTube covering a broad range of educational topics. Khan Academy has a higher rate of videos viewed in comparison to MIT's OCW . The Kahn Academy launched an official app both for Android and iPhone (Figure 17 a. January 2011) and iPad app (March 2012). Its main functionality is providing access to videos. There are also unofficial viewer apps that let import the Facebook profile (Figure 17 b.c.).

Easy to create and consume mobile contents are those whose unit of construction (also called granularity) is less complex, i.e. text, audio or video. Smartphones and tablets are equipped from scratch with tools that facilitate easy creation and consumption of this type of materials, as no special app or feature needs to be installed. Most of the studies reviewed in this chapter pull materials with low granularity. The work from Yang M-C. (2007) adapting already existing desktop-based learning materials to the mobile setting advise the use of technologies like HTML5 to make easier integration of audio, video, and texts in mobile platforms (see Khan Academy official app). Adapting more complex contents like LOs to become mobile LOs is hard to sustain in long terms since the crazy train of technology is continuously evolving the features from new mobile devices. Previous LOs were designed and created for desktop platforms and some of their features are missed when moved to a mobile context (screen size, content sequencing, etc.). Bradley's et al. describe this incompatibility as “\em LOs were developed to tackle a series of pedagogical challenges, such as facilitating learner engagement, and aiding students in dealing with problems of abstraction and complexity. These learning objects use a number of constructivist principles provided by rich interactive visualizations or learner controlled pacing\em ”. The review of the apps existing in commercial market concluded with no “killer app” that adapted desktop-based LOs to for mobile devices. Nevertheless, we have highlighted apps sequencing learning contents (e.g. eXact and MW-TELL mobile app), as well as best practices to scaffold architectures to facilitate across platform accessibility (iOS, Android, Windows) compatibility like web-services, APIs, or HTML5.

From the repository’ point of view, the results of the survey indicate that the majority of the content repositories are accessible by different mobile devices (via web browser). These results provide an overall view of the extent to which repositories are in a significant need to adapt their architectures for mobile devices rather than adapting the content. Hence, repositories should provide content that can be delivered via HTTP (e.g. via web-services) to any device, as well as formatted following formatting (e.g. HTML5) and sequencing (e.g. SCORM) standards to foster universal access to open communities.
