I have no words to express my gratitude to my wife Natalia for her company, understanding, and appreciation for joining this  trip.

I want to place a very special thank to my parents Soledad and Miguel Ángel, as well as my grandmother Pilar for being an example of strength and constancy. Papá, Yaya os quiero. Thanks to my Ironman brother José Miguel and my sweetie sister Soledad for their integrity and perseverance during these years. Also, many thanks to my second sister Sumaya, to my metal brother Juanma, and to the Hernández Garrido family for their loyalty. Thanks a lot to my mad nephew Miguel Ángel, and my restless nieces María and Elena for being a source of happiness. Also, a hearty thank you to my brother-in-law David for the excellent design of this thesis' cover, as well as to the rest of my “familia maña” for their nobleness and affection.

This thesis was made possible (and fun) thanks to the guidance and inspiring ideas from Marcus Specht, Marco Kalz, and Stefaan Ternier. Thanks for making this experience unforgettable.

I would like to thank my paranimfen, Halszka Jarodzka and Dirk Börner for their friendship and broad support from the very first minute of this adventure.

Furthermore, I want to say thank you to my family at the Open Universiteit: Mieke Hammers, Birgit Schmitz, Hendrik Drachsler, Dominique Verpoorten, Sebastian Kelle, Guido van Dijk, Ángel Suárez, Charlotte Wolff, Jeroen Berkhout, Jorome Gijselaers, Jeroen Storm, Angelique Lansu, Jan Schneider, Maren Scheffel, Roland Klemke, Soude Fazeli, Martin van Dijk, Kiavash Bahreini … and to my friends at the Global OER Graduate Network.

Finally, I would like to thank Nacho Vegas, my guitar, my running shoes, my friends at the Atlético Bocarranas, and the team of \textit{Tiempo de Juego} “... no se confundan”, for being an effective mood booster on rainy days.
