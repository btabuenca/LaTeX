This paper presents the results from a questionnaire filled out by 147 lifelong learners with the aim to analyse learning practices of adults, and to recognise patterns of lifelong learners in order to support them with technology. These patterns capture the context in which lifelong learners are more willing to learn, that is, the day of the week, duration, location activity being performed, type of device being used, way to interact with their devices and how these aspects can affect when an adult student takes the initiative to learn. Likewise, this paper examines previous publications on surveys, questionnaires and information collected with the same objective, to corroborate and contrast the findings. Moreover, we present a literature review on augmented tangibles for learning identifying potential contexts to orchestrate tangibles depending on the physical space where they are normally used. As an outcome of this work, important research questions are raised to integrate smart learning objects in learner-centred ecologies of resources.

\section{Introduction}
Lifelong learners are confronted with a broad range of activities they have to manage every day. In most cases they have to combine learning, working and everyday life throughout the day. For the support of lifelong learners, their daily practices and learning patterns are of importance. Lifelong learning includes a variety of different educational scenarios and contexts in which learners operate. These contexts include traditional formal programmes, non-formal education, on the job-training and informal, accidental learning. \cite{Fischer} even values lifelong learning as a mindset that people have to acquire including the following learning scenarios: self-directed learning, learning on demand, collaborative learning and organisational learning.

One of the most critical challenges for the implementation of lifelong learning is to integrate real world problems and learning in the same process. One promising approach to connect the world of working and learning is a pattern approach. According to \cite{Alexander1977} each pattern describes a “problem, which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem”. \cite{Rohse2006} propose design patterns that should enable the detailed formalised description of “the dynamics between learning and technologies without the potential ideological or pedagogical mask of teaching in formal education and training settings”. In the setting of an adult lifelong learner, this is especially difficult as in most cases interests might be highly distributed over different domains and keeping up learning needs an extra effort. Lowing the barriers for access to relevant information and support services anywhere, anytime, and anyhow is one essential component for efficient lifelong learning support.

The idea of a Personal Learning Environment (PLE) recognises that learning is ongoing and seeks to provide tools to support this kind of learning. It also recognises the importance of the individual to organise his or her own learning in order to embed it in contexts of daily life \citep{Attwell2007a}. Personal learning has been hierarchised into learning activities, episodes and projects \citep{Vavoula2002,tough1979adult}. \cite{Vavoula2002} define ‘learning activity’ as the distinct acts that the person carries out during reading, discussing, listening and making notes. \cite{tough1979adult} defines a ‘learning episode’ as a well-defined period of time that is held together by the similarity in intent, activity or place of the thoughts and actions that occur during it; it has a definite beginning and ending in time. ‘Learning projects’ are formed by grouping episodes together on the basis of their contingency in terms of purposes and outcomes that could happen at different locations.

Smartphones have been pinpointed as a key learning partner, not only because of their affordances supporting learning activities (camera, bigger screens, location capabilities, audio and video player and recorder, sensors etc.), but also because they provide utilities to track users lifelong learning. \cite{Wong2012} advocates the combination of a cloud-based ‘learning hub’ account, a smartphone, and additional notebook/desktop computers as an ideal technical setting for a personalised seamless learning environment.

Moreover, the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the capacity to integrate smaller and more sophisticated digital technology into physical objects has triggered the generation of new materials to improve and augment tangibles [e.g. SnapToTrace electronic textile \citep{Stark2012}, embedded soft material displays \citep{Ozsvald2012}. There are everyday scenarios built by lifelong learners in recognition of the places where they perform interactions with spaces, artefacts and resources through which people achieve their work. These places are more suitable to build lifelong learning ecologies supported by resources attached to concrete locations. Tangibles for learning have been reviewed to be used in the formal classroom, and according to different disciplines, subjects and ages \citep{OMalley2004}. No work was found classifying tangibles depending on where the physical space where the learning activity is performed.

The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we analyse the results of a questionnaire for lifelong learners and classify the data according to the following criteria: type of mobile device; lifelong learners’ behaviour, timing, motivation, physical spaces, where learning takes place learning activity being performed, user is waiting or on-the-move, and gender. Second, we present a literature review on augmented tangibles for learning according to where does the learning activity occur. Finally, we discuss findings reported in this work, that is, we highlight patterns that enable lifelong learners to design PLEs, and encourage users to make what they learn throughout the day a deliberate object of attention, reflect about the available learning channels \citep{Tabuenca2012d}, and be aware about the learning opportunities embedded in daily activities. Moreover we describe our future research.
\section{A questionnaire on mobile usage habits}
\subsection{Method}
This paper describes the results from a questionnaire filled by 147 lifelong learners (See table \ref{tbl:table1}) \citep{Tabuenca2012}. The questionnaire was distributed both in English (See Appendix A) and Spanish taking advantage of the following channels: social networks, three Dutch and Spanish universities, two high schools from Belgium and The Netherlands, two companies, one academy for skills-training and the author’s blog. The survey was stored in an online platform so that everybody could access and fill out the questionnaire making use of the distributed URL. Answers were collected over the course of three months. Participation was voluntary and unrewarded.

The questionnaire is composed of 21 items, these are: five multiple choice questions, six single select questions, nine matrix selection questions, and one open answer question. An introduction section (60 words) was included in order to explain the aim of the questionnaire and to define frequently used concepts within the items. These concepts are: \em(a) mobile device: regular phone, smartphone, tablet, multimedia player and laptop when used not always in the same place; (b) learn: taking the initiative to learn something actively. It can be related to work, current studies or self-fulfilment\em.

There are four questions about demographics (age, genre, occupation, and professional domain), three questions about usage patterns with mobile devices, two questions about how timing and content are related, seven questions linking activities, locations, and ways of interaction with lifelong learners’ mobile devices, one question identifying difficulties when learning with mobile devices, three questions about the lifelong learners’ motivation, and one more question to estimate how familiar is the concept of \em lifelong learning \em for the participants.

The data with the answers have been exported from the online survey platform to a spreadsheet file. This file has been imported with a database engine in order to create a table for each of the questions in the survey. A database client has been used to build joining-table queries (ANNEX V), aiming to find patterns in the answers given in different questions. Chart reports have been created from these requests to carry out the analysis.

The results of this questionnaire are presented including references to previous studies on mobile device usage patterns and mobile learning support, in order to contrast and corroborate the conclusions.

\subsection{Results}
\subsubsection{The concept of 'lifelong learning'}
Participants have given the following definition in order for us to assess how familiar they were with the concept of ‘lifelong learning’: “\em All learning activity undertaken throughout life, with the aim of improving knowledge, skills and competences within a personal, civic, social and/or employment-related perspective \em” (European Commission, 2011). When participants were asked whether they considered lifelong learners themselves, 21.76\% reported a negative answer. However, it is paradoxically that these same respondents answered positively to the question ‘\em Do you have a natural motivation to learn? \em’

\subsubsection{Patterns based on type of device, lifelong learners' behaviour and timing}
The presence of mobile devices in lifelong learners’ daily activities is a fact and this can be gathered from the results of the questionnaire. Portable computers are used every day by 70.06\% of the respondents. Smartphones are used every day by 56.46\% of the respondents, while 17.68\% use their tablet on a daily basis.

Trends indicate that smartphones and tablets are the cornerstone in future learning designs since they are even more portable than portable computers. The smartphone is easily carried around in a pocket and can be used in any moment of the day. A study performed by \cite{Arbitron2011} concluded that engagement with different smartphone features is divided evenly during the day detecting a slight peak in the afternoon from 15 h to 18 h.

Our results show that there are two time slots of the day in which lifelong learners feel more motivated to learn, these are from 10 h to 12 h (55.78\%) and from 16 h to 20 h (49,66\%). This discontinuity is happening due to the pause to have lunch, in which generally people change their context, that is, using a way of transport or simply commute the place for some time. Our study (see Figure \ref{fig:2}) shows a difference for ‘motivation to learn’ between people that own a smartphone and those that do not own one. Individuals that own smartphone expressed to be more constantly motivated during the day than non-smartphone users.
\begin{figure}

     \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{img/survey_fig2}
     \caption{Motivation to learn during the day. Smartphone users (black line) vs non-smartphone users (grey line)}
     \label{fig:2}
\end{figure}
A study by \cite{Eoff2011} based on one-week click data in the bitly online link tracking platform1 concluded that tablets (iPads) usage during the day is not flat and drastically different when compared to other types of devices, including smartphones and portable computers. These results suggest that usage lowers after breakfast, remains low during traditional working hours and does not peak until much later in the evening (19 h–00 h). The results of the questionnaire for lifelong learners suggest that there is an association between tablet users and their motivation to learn. The percentage of tablet users motivated to learn was 10\% higher than with individuals that do not use tablets (see Figure \ref{fig:3}). In relation to the peak observed late in the evening by \cite{Eoff2011}, our results show that the learning-motivation-curve in tablet users in the last hours of the day does not descend so much in comparison to non-tablet-users.
\begin{figure}

     \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{img/survey_fig3}
     \caption{Motivation to learn during the day. Tablet users (black line) vs non-tablet users (grey line)}
     \label{fig:3}
\end{figure}
Eoff’s results \citep{Eoff2011} suggest that tablets are mainly used for entertainment purposes since they are less used than the rest during working times. Tablet usage is higher than the rest of the devices during leisure time. This effect can be also observed during the weekends when tablets usage between 8 h and 15 h is higher than during the week at those same hours. No other device sees a heavy increase of use during the weekends.

When asking lifelong learners on which days of the week do they spend more time with their mobile device(s), our results show (see Figure \ref{fig:4}) that usage for smartphone- users is flat with a slight peak on Friday and there is always a higher percentage in comparison to non-smartphone users. There is an increase of 30\% in non-smartphone- users from a working day (Thursday) to weekend day (Saturday).

There are different ways of consuming multimedia contents with mobile devices, these are: \em listening, reading, writing, watching,\em and \em gaming \em. When lifelong learners were asked how long on average they spend on each of these ways of interaction, 21\% of the individuals reported to listen more than one hour per day to their mobile devices. This preference for listening can also be inferred from the results. Media players are used at least once a week by 64.62\%, of the respondents.

When lifelong learners where asked how much time do they spend on different topics per day, the outcome was that \em study \em, \em music \em and \em social networking \em are the activities on which they spend most of their time. In contrast to these results, the study performed by \cite{Arbitron2011} with similar topics indicates that messaging, browsing, social networking and voice are the activities on which individuals spend more time.

Examining the way in which individuals check their mobile phone for a new SMS, missed call, email or any other notification, there are two different behaviours that can be gathered from the results of the questionnaire. There is a first group of individuals (37.41\%) that only check incoming notifications when the device warns them with an alert. The second group’s behaviour is performed by the individuals (34.68\%) that check it continuously, this means, at least once per hour. Comparing behaviours between genders, it is remarkable that the option ‘I only check my mobile when it alerts me’ was answered by 44\% of the men and 28\% of the women. Women’s behaviour was more evenly distributed among the rest of the options (‘once a day’ and ‘once every four hours’).

     \label{fig:4}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Linking locations, activities and ways of interaction with mobile devices}
A study performed by \cite{Google2011} on 5013 adults, who identified themselves as using their smartphones to access the internet, concluded that there are two main situations where they use smartphone. These are being at home (93\%) and on-the-go (87\%). Moreover, adults were requested for which activities they also use internet on their smartphone. The highest rate was obtained (59\%) for the activity ‘\em Waiting \em (in the line at the market, doc, office, bus, etc.)’. The questionnaire for lifelong learners has focused on these three main contexts including six items with the aim to identify patterns that link locations (living room, kitchen, bathroom, working/sleeping room, on-the-move and, waiting for someone), actions normally performed in those locations (e.g. having breakfast, brushing your teeth, lying on bed, etc.), and ways of interaction with mobile devices (listen, watch videos, write and read), also defined as \em learning activities \em by \cite{tough1979adult}. These results have raised some interesting differences regarding the way in which participants reported to behave depending on their gender.
\subsubsection{At home}
\em Sitting in the sofa \em is the most popular place to interact with mobile devices, not only compared to any activity performed being in the living room or anywhere at home, but also outdoors and on-the-move. Exactly 62.58\% of respondents reported that they normally \em read \em contents, 50.34\% \em write \em contents, 44.89\% \em watch \em videos and 34.01\% \em listen \em to audios while being in the sofa. The \em living room \em was reported to be the most popular place to read contents, and specifying more, \em being sat in the sofa \em and \em watching TV during advertisement time \em (47.61\%). There was also a high rate of respondents that reported to write contents while watching TV during advertisement time (32.64\%).

The main finding that can be gather from responses regarding the context being in the bathroom is that this intimate place has a significant association with mobile device interaction when used for listening, that is, the individuals reported to listen while having a shower (23.12\%), making-up/shaving (18.36\%) and brushing their teeth (18.36\%). Being on the toilet is the most compatible activity with the different ways of interaction, that is, 33.33\% of the respondents used their mobile device to \em read \em, 21.08\% to \em write \em and 11.56\% to \em listen \em. The poll performed by \cite{Google2011} stated that 39\% of the adults had used the internet on their smartphone while \em using the bathroom \em, and 8\% while taking a \em shower/bathing \em.

The majority of the respondents (54.42\%) reported that they normally read contents on their mobile devices while \em being sat at the desk \em, 51.69\% \em read \em, 37.41\% \em listen \em and 29.92\% \em watch videos \em, this means that the \em desk \em is the best place to interact with mobile devices while \em being in the room \em. Furthermore, the \em bed \em is suited to interact with mobile devices \em reading \em (50.33), \em listening \em (34.69), \em watching \em (34.01\%) and \em writing \em (33.32\%).

The \em kitchen \em is a location associated with to perform learning activities while \em listening \em on mobile devices. The results from this questionnaire suggest the same effects than the ones observed to the context being in the bathroom where mobile devices are mainly used for \em listening \em. The main contexts where participants embed their listening-learning-activity are while \em cooking \em (30.6\%) and \em heating the breakfast \em (25.84\%). It is only remarkable that 16.32\% of the respondents interact with their mobile devices to read contents while \em cooking \em, probably requesting cook-recipes or short messaging while boiling, frying or anything in the oven. The survey by \cite{Google2011} indicated that 27\% of the participants had used the internet on their smartphone while \em cooking/and or other household chores \em.
\subsubsection{Waiting}
Results depict that waiting for someone/something is not a context in which respondents consume video contents in contrast to the rest of ways of interaction, since the rates are low varying from 15.64\% (being in the airport) to 4.76\% (waiting in a commercial centre). The \em bus \em stop (43.52\%) and the \em train station \em (41.49\%) are the most suitable places to interact with mobile devices reading contents while waiting for someone/something. When \em writing \em on mobile devices, the highest rates are evenly distributed (approximately 38\%) for the following contexts: \em waiting \em at the bus stop, at the train station and anywhere in the street.
\subsubsection{On-the-move}
The results from the study performed by \cite{Kim2005} indicate that the most common context for using mobile internet is described as follows: \em participants have a hedonic goal, their emotional state is high, their legs are stopped, visual and auditory distractions were low \em, few people are around them, and their interaction is low. This is a different picture from the widely held belief that the mobile internet would be used often while moving outdoors. However, mobile devices have improved their capabilities to access the internet since 2005, e.g. bigger displays, touch screens and faster connections and mobile interaction with smartphones is different nowadays. Our results suggest that interaction with mobile devices on-the-go is mainly carried out \em listening \em, being in the train 51.69\%, 50.33\% bus, and walking 48.3\%. \em Reading \em contents is the second most popular way of interaction when moving, being 50.33\% by train, 40.82\% by bus, and 36.73\% accompanying the car driver. The train is the most popular place to interact with mobile devices while listening, reading and writing, and the plane is the most popular place to \em watch videos \em. The poll performed by \cite{Google2011} stated that 43\% of the individuals had used the internet on their smartphone while commuting to work/school and 20\% driving by vehicle.

     \label{fig:5}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Gender}
Regarding the gender effects, our results show some evidence on the fact that certain learning activities were more pronounced in men than women and vice versa (see Figure \ref{fig:6}). On the one hand, there are a 44.18\% of men that reported to use their mobile devices reading contents while being sat on the toilet; however, only 18.02\% of the women do so. This difference was also notable for writing contents (29.05\% men vs. 9.83\% women) and watching videos (15.11\% men vs. 3.27\% women). However, gender did not moderate the effects of listening contents. On the other hand, differences were also found regarding to listen to contents in some particular places. Women reported to be more willing to use their mobile devices while cooking (42.60\% women vs. 22.08\% men), sorting groceries (26.21\% women vs. 5.81\% men) in the kitchen, and cleaning in the living room (49.16\% women vs. 29.05\% men). Moreover, it is remarkable that for the context \em waiting \em for someone/something in a commercial centre, 37.24\% of the men reported to read contents in their mobile devices while only 16.38\% of the women reported so.

     \label{fig:6}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Missing Learning Activities}
Participants were asked whether they had missed in the questionnaire any other activity where they usually get along some learning episode with or without their mobile devices. They reported sport activities like ‘running’, ‘cycling’ or ‘at the gym’, on-the-go activities like ‘taking a walk’ or ‘walking the dog’, and some other miscellaneous ones like ‘having lunch/dinner alone in a bar’, ‘feeding the infant’, ‘taking care of infant’ and ‘while doing some do-it-yourself labour at home (carpentry, plumbing...)’. The poll performed by \cite{Google2011} concluded that 48\% of the adults had been eating while using the internet on their smartphone, 17\% walking their dog and 13\% playing sports. Another respondent reminded us that there are no patterns for every situation and he/she reported ‘\em I just learn something when I find the time \em’.

\subsubsection{Difficulties When Learning With Mobile Devices}
\cite{Wong2011a} identified ten seams by which learning experiences are disrupted today and for which Mobile-assisted Seamless Learning (MSL) technology has to find new solutions. The identified ten gaps (MSL1-10) in seamless learning support are of high relevance for lifelong learners. Participants were asked about seven of these ten gaps in two items of the survey. The remaining three gaps (MSL5, 9, 10) were too complex concepts to deal in this poll and will be treated in suitable future studies.

The above paragraphs ‘On-the-move’ and ‘Patterns based on type of device, lifelong learners’ behaviour’ provide evidences to confirm the existence of both ‘across location’ (MSL4) and ‘across time’ (MSL3) gaps in the participants. Some cues are also exposed on how to resume these gaps supported with mobile technology. Participants were requested to report how often do they encounter these difficulties (MSL1-3 and MSL6-8) when learning and assisted with their mobile devices. The results from the questionnaire indicate that participants varying from 12\% to 17\% in the different MSLs ‘usually’ find these difficulties. Nevertheless, approx. 34\% of the respondents reported ‘not a difficulty’ in all these difficulties. The most remarkable difficulty is ‘find suitable slots of time during the day’ with a 21.08\% of the respondents that reported to have it ‘usually’ and a 4.76\% that find it ‘always’. Slightly higher rates to the three resting difficulties, and with similar rates between them were ‘Combined use of multiple device types (laptop, mobile phone and/or tablet)’ and ‘Linking real world to what I learned digitally’ with approximately 17\% of the respondents that ‘usually’ found these difficulties.

An extended study performed by \cite{Eurostat2012} concluded that the two most commonly cited obstacles to participation in education and training among those who wanted to participate but did not do so were: lack of time due to family responsibilities (36.6 \% of those not participating) and conflict with work schedules (35.0 \%).
\section{A review on smart objects for learning}
In 2009 smart objects have been named in the Horizon report, as one of the relevant technology trends with a time-to-adoption between four to five years \citep{johnson20092009}. In principle, the report defines smart objects as ‘\em objects that know about themselves and link the real world with digital information \em’. Smart objects in that sense use embedded technology to track state changes in the environment and their context without altering objects original aspect. Relevant technologies are QR codes and barcodes, RFID and NFC technologies, all ‘other kind of embedded sensor technologies that can track changes of objects’ state as the accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope, and others.

In our work, we focus on the use of smart objects for learning and therefore we propose the concept of Smart Learning Object (SLO). We define SLO as: ‘Any augmented tangible resource that can be used to learn or support learning activities’.

This section presents a review on tangibles for learning since early years (1997) to nowadays (2012). The first sub-section gives an overview on related work based on a literature review. Next, SLOs are presented as the evolution of tangibles for learning, providing a workable definition. This section concludes with a review of the conference series on Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction (TEI) from 2007 to pursuing identify potential contexts to orchestrate tangibles with learning purposes.
\subsection{At home}
\em Our own home \em seems to be a suitable place to learn intimate and closely acquainted issues since we all spend many hours and pursue many activities at home. In the review, we have found smart objects that make us aware of our energy consumption patterns and support us on the way to learn about sustainability and improve our usage habits. The thrifty faucet \citep{Togler2009} is a pervasive home appliance that takes a different position depending on the water consumption during the last period of time, so whenever you use more water, it adopts a curled position and it is more difficult to get water from it.

One more example of an embedded smart object giving feedback about habits in daily life has been brought to practice by \cite{Nakajima2008} and takes place in the \em bathroom \em. An augmented toothbrush recognises toothbrushing patterns by analysing the acceleration data. The virtual aquarium displays animations giving positive or negative feedback depending on how effective the toothbrushing is. Both the toothbrush and the phone are augmented can be combined to teach hygiene habits. Mirrors, located in the bathroom, have been augmented with different purposes \citep{Schmeer2011,Roy2009} and seem to be potential SLOs to take part in future LLL ecologies.

SLOs track our behaviour while we rest in the \em bedroom \em. The \em PillowTalk \em (Schiphorst et al., 2007) is an augmented pillow that gives feedback on the correct position to sleep with a serious game. Furthermore, there is a variety of commercial products around body scale, sleep behaviour, healthcare, and others.

The \em kitchen \em is usually one of the rooms equipped with more appliances. Nowadays, it is not difficult to find fridges with a computer integrated in the market. They provide different kinds of facilities from counting the number of calories you take by reading the barcode of the consumed products, until a warning system alerting the owner when any product is going out of date. The \em impatient toaster \em \citep{Burneleit2009} is an augmented toaster designed to motivate its owners to eat more often and in regular intervals: after not using it for a while, it signals hunger through nervous movements. The \em augmented cutting board \em and the \em sensor-enriched knife \em \citep{Kranz2007} enable the environment to determine the type of food handled during the preparation of meals.

Some other activities normally practiced out of home in specialised places like a clinic or gymnasium are embedded in daily life with the support of smart objects and brought to the living room. The Yoga-Tablet touch screen and the augmented mat \citep{Nagargoje2012} enable any room to become a place to practice yoga. The \em ReWall \em (augmented decorative textile) and the \em ReSwing \em (augmented swing) \citep{Bagalkot2012} represent smart objects in the field of rehabilitation technology that supports an integration of physiotherapy with the everyday life.
\subsection{At workplace \& classroom}
Apart from our own home, the \em workplace \em or the \em classroom \em are places where we all invest a big percentage of our lives. Within the same embodied interaction paradigm as the previous paragraph, \em Limber \em \citep{Leung2012} is an interconnected system of wearables (augmented wrist band and neck sensor) designed to reduce repetitive stress injury among knowledge workers. Furthermore, smart objects tend to play an important role in order to support trainings in the working environment. These are some of the examples found in the review: \em DressUp \em \citep{ERATO2012} is a computerised system for designing dresses with 3D input using an augmented mannequin as a guide. The \em tangible video editor \em \citep{Zigelbaum2007} is a multi-user tangible interface for sequencing digital video by using multiple handheld computers embedded in plastic tokens.

There is extensive use of tangible objects in teaching mathematics especially in children’s education (e.g. \cite{Dienes1971,montessori1917advanced}). Manipulation of concrete objects helps to learn abstract mathematics concepts. Nowadays, algebra or geometry is the main target topics when building SLOs to learn mathematics. In the branch of algebra, we identified the \em wooden beam \em \citep{Leong2011} a significant example of an SLO designed with formal learning purposes The results obtained in this experimenting with this tangible suggest that students can better understand equations’ concepts when equations are constructed on a tangible wooden beam with plastic tokens, and the graphical user interface is displayed on a connected laptop.

The Smart Blocks \citep{Girouard2007} is group of tangibles equipped with RFID tags, used to support learning geometry skills. These blocks are augmented mathematical manipulatives that allow users to explore the concepts of volume and surface area of three-dimensional objects.
\section{Conclusions}
The aim of the questionnaire for lifelong learners is to analyse learning daily activities in adults, and recognise patterns in lifelong learners, in order to shed light on new ways to support them with mobile technologies. The analysis of the results arises the ten following findings:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Portable computers are the most used type of device. Recent studies \citep{Wesel2011} have found similar results arguing ergonomic reasons. Furthermore, students prefer bigger screen compared to smartphones or tablets. Moreover, we think that portable computers are supplanting the heavy desktops because the drop in the prices \citep{Tapellini2011,Khariff2009} in the last years.
\item Individuals that own a smartphone reported to be more constantly motivated to learn during the day than non-smartphone users.
\item Individuals that own smartphone use them constantly during the whole week. The rest of the individuals reported lower usage during working days and an increase during the weekends.
\item Listening is the most compatible learning activity when performing other tasks at the same time. It is also the one where adults spend more time and in longer time slots. These results suggest that audio is very suitable for distributing learning materials. Audio contents can be consumed from any media player, which are very affordable since they can be found independently or embedded in most of the phones.
\item There are two different behaviours when adults check their mobile phone for a new SMS, missed call, email or any other notification. There is a group that only checks incoming notifications when the device warns them with an alert. There is another group that check it continuously. These results suggest that two behaviours must be taken into account when building mobile applications for learning. Users attend to notification coming from his/her mobile device: continuously polling; check based on warning event (vibration, sound, icon on the screen desktop...).
\item There is an association between the learning activity being performed (reading, listening, writing or watching) and the concrete location where it takes place. Some patterns were found in the way to interact with mobile devices while being at home and depending on the room where the individuals were located. Participants were more willing to perform any kind of activity with their mobile device(s) while being in the living room or in the sleeping/working room. Nevertheless, participants reported that the kitchen and the bathroom were places where they use to perform the ‘listening’ learning activity.
\item Learning activities are mainly performed when adults are with their legs stopped. The \em reading \em and \em writing \em learning activities mostly take place being sat (sofa, desk, train, bus and toilet) or lying on somewhere (bed). Sitting in the sofa is the concrete place where adults reported the higher acceptance when carrying out any learning activity. However, the ‘listening’ learning activity that takes part more evenly in the different locations and embedded in different activities.
\item Men and women behave in a differently when making use of their mobile devices. These results suggest that man and women seem to behave differently, not only in the way to perform learning activities depending on the context, but also in the way to attend to an incoming notification on their mobile phones. Furthermore, the study performed by \cite{Ofcom2010} stated that men spend nearly an hour more per day using media than women.
\item Lifelong learners reported that their learning experiences are disrupted. Finding a suitable time slot to learn during the day is the most frequent difficulty reported by participants. These results and the ones by \cite{Eurostat2012} suggest that there is a need to integrate learning activities in daily life.
\item There is a high rate of individuals that are not familiarised with the concept of ‘lifelong learning’.
\end{enumerate}
The review of SLOs attached to physical spaces has revealed the following findings: Nowadays, physical spaces such as classroom, workplaces, homes, or ways of transport are enriched with ambient displays, smart boards, multi-touch screens, WI-FI connection and smart objects. Nevertheless, these artefacts mostly work in standalone mode and are rarely interconnected. There is a need to orchestrate technologies augmenting physical spaces so they can be integrated and seamlessly managed in a learning flow. \cite{Hernandez-Leo2012} present an example on how to orchestrate SLOs in physical spaces. Same conclusion can be derived for the orchestration of SLOs in subject-oriented contexts and learner’s abilities-oriented contexts.
\begin{enumerate}
\item SLOs can be found in formal and informal learning environments and a variety of application domains. Reviewed SLOs related to healthcare, diet, wellness, and exercising are placed at home. SLOs related to formal education are placed in the classroom. This means, SLOs with a common learning goal might be naturally grouped by lifelong learners and associated with concrete physical spaces.
\item SLOs are often perceived in an isolated manner. This review has revealed that the majority of the artefacts were not equipped with capabilities, namely RIFD, NFC or application interfaces that let them extend their interactions. This paradigm is described by \cite{Vasseur2010} and prototyped in recently proposed middleware \citep{Bernardos2011,Gama2012,Kawsar2008}. Nevertheless, these models are lacking links to educational instruction design and orchestration.
\item Most of the SLOs reviewed implement a simple behaviour change model or neo- behaviouristic approach by giving feedback based on data-collection or real-time data feedback. Very few examples found in the review have an underpinning didactical model used for the design of the SLO.
\item There is no didactical metadata attached to SLOs with the aim to define its educational purpose. The learning aim of many of the enumerated SLOs was not explicit and sometimes it was difficult to determine ‘what is not learning for lifelong learners?’. There is a need to embed this data so lifelong learners can be aware what the SLOs is offering to learn.
\item SLOs (reviewed in this work) are not aligned with the “\em ideal technical setting for a personalized seamless learning environment \em” \citep{Wong2012}. SLOs should implement interfaces to interact both with smart devices and cloud-based services or content repositories \citep{Tabuenca2012c}. In this scenario, smartphones will act not only as a hub (24 hours a day \ 7 days a week) aware of the learning opportunities supplied by the SLOs surrounding the lifelong learner, but also tracking his/her learning embedded in daily activities. SLOs should take advantage of cloud-based containers facilities (e.g. COSM2) to track and store sensor information. This fact would imply the transformation of SLOs in Holmquist’s categorisation \citep{holmquist1999token} from information ‘\em containers \em’ to ‘\em tools \em’ that are used to manipulate digital information. An interface between SLOs and learning objects repositories might facilitate reusability of learning contents.
\end{enumerate}

     \caption{User's scaffolding of personal learning environments across locations, time and devices}
     \label{fig:9}
\end{figure}
Based on the idea that the opportunity to learn and to grow is all around and should not be a chore for lifelong learners, we will extend this research creating a learner-centred model in which smartphones will be able to interact with SLOs, ambient displays for learning \citep{Borner2013}, learning containers \citep{Tabuenca2012c} and tagged physical objects that could trigger different activities and lead to learning events (see Figure \ref{fig:9}). This model will define how channels and artefacts can be linked in order to adapt and serve the information according to adults’ preferences (location, embedded in learning activity, time of the day, duration of the task, gender, etc.).

From the ubiquitous learning paradigm perspective, we will provide empirical argumentations to support the provided patterns by testing with ARLearn \citep{Ternier2012} the combination of learning scenarios arisen in the questionnaire. This tool provides capabilities to augment physical spaces by pushing/pulling learning contents addressed by NFC and QR indexes. This software will also be able to launch learning contents to be presented and consumed in different channels and physical spaces. The purpose of this work is to make the best use of learning resources that are available to lifelong learners, to give them technological support across physical spaces, switching between learning tasks, and making use of smart objects embedded in daily activities.
